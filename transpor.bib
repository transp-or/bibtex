	n2 = {Discrete choice modeling is a fundamental part of travel demand forecasting. To date, this field has been dominated by parametric approaches (e.g., logit models), but non-parametric approaches such as artificial neural networks (ANNs) possess much potential since choice problems can be assimilated to pattern recognition problems. In particular, ANN models are easily applicable with their higher capability to identify nonlinear relationships between inputs and designated outputs to predict choice behaviors. This article investigates the capability of four types of ANN model and compares their prediction performance with a conventional multinomial logit model (MNL) for mode choice problems. The four ANNs are: backpropagation neural networks (BPNNs), radial basis function networks (RBFNs), probabilistic neural networks (PNNs), and clustered probabilistic neural networks (CPNNs). To compare the modeling techniques, we present the algorithmic differences of each ANN technique, and we assess their prediction accuracy with a 10-fold cross-validation method. Furthermore, we assess the contribution of explanatory variables by conducting sensitivity analyses on significant variables. The results show that ANN models outperform MNL, with prediction accuracies around 80{\%} compared with 70{\%} for MNL. Moreover, PNN performs best out of all ANNs, especially to predict underrepresented modes.},

	abstract = {Conventional methods of estimating latent behaviour generally use attitudinal questions which are subjective and these survey questions may not always be available. We hypothesize that an alternative approach such as non-parametric artificial neural networks can be used for latent variable estimation through an undirected graphical models. In this study, we explore the use of generative non-parametric modelling methods to estimate latent variables from prior choice distribution without the conventional use of measurement indicators. A restricted Boltzmann machine is used to represent latent behaviour factors by analyzing the relationship information between the observed choices and explanatory variables. The algorithm is adapted for latent behaviour analysis in discrete choice scenario and we use a graphical approach to evaluate and understand the semantic meaning from estimated parameter vector values. We illustrate our methodology on a financial instrument choice dataset and perform statistical analysis on parameter sensitivity and stability. Our findings show that through non-parametric statistical tests, we can extract useful latent information on the behaviour of latent constructs through machine learning methods and present strong and significant influence on the choice process. Furthermore, our modelling framework shows robustness in input variability through sampling and validation.},

	abstract = {We present stated preference data based on a national representative Swiss online panel survey related to preference of mixed renewable energy infrastructure in landscapes. Data were collected between November 2018 and March 2019 via an online questionnaire and yielded 1026 responses. The online questionnaire consisted of two main parts --(1) questions covering meanings related to landscapes, nature and renewable energy infrastructure and questions regarding the ``fit''of landscape/renewable energy infrastructure (REI) combinations and (2) a stated choice experiment. While in the first part of the questionnaire we asked respondents about their personal connection to certain landscapes, to nature and to specific REI, we also asked them to evaluate the fitting of seven different Swiss landscapes (near natural alpine areas, northern alps, touristic alpine areas, agricultural plateau, urban plateau, Jura ridges, urban alpine valley) with five different REI (wind, PV ground/agricultural, PV ground/other, PV roof, power lines) combinations. In the second part of the questionnaire, the stated choice experiment confronted respondents with 15 consecutive choice tasks, with each task involving a choice between two ``energy system transformation''options and an opt-out option (none). Each choice option (beside the opt-out option) included four unlabeled attributes (landscape, wind energy infrastructure, photovoltaic energy infrastructure, high voltage overhead power line infrastructure) with varying levels. Due to data cleaning procedures (item nonresponse) the number of responses used within hybrid choice modeling and analysis was n = 844 (12,660 choice observations). An analysis of the hybrid choice model and further insights are presented in the article ``How landscape-technology fit affects public evaluations of renewable energy infrastructure scenarios. A hybrid choice model.''},

	abstract = {The objective of this paper is to verify/validate the results of an application of the Travel Activity Scheduler for Household Agents (TASHA) in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), Canada. Activity generation and scheduling components of TASHA are validated using 1996 and 2001 travel survey data for the GTA. This validation proceeds in two parts: (a) verification that TASHA replicates the 1996 base case upon which the model was originally built; and (b) comparison of TASHA's forecasts of 2001 daily travel behaviour with observed travel survey data for 2001. TASHA activity generation and scheduling model components replicate observed activities with good accuracy and precision for the base year. Although TASHA is not able to predict an observed increase in activity participation rate in a five year forecast, the distribution of activities in the day is forecast with greater success. Predictions of average travel distance are oversimulated in the base year by 0.9{\%}. Increased average distances are underpredicted for school, shopping, and other activities, and are overpredicted for work and return home activities. These validation results are promising, although there exist opportunities to improve model performance, and to further validate other elements of the TASHA model.},

@article{Astroza:2018aa,
	abstract = {This paper is motivated by the increasing recognition that modeling activity-travel demand for a single day of the week, as is done in virtually all travel forecasting models, may be inadequate in capturing underlying processes that govern activity-travel scheduling behavior. The considerable variability in daily travel suggests that there are important complementary relationships and competing tradeoffs involved in scheduling and allocating time to various activities across days of the week. Both limited survey data availability and methodological challenges in modeling week-long activity-travel schedules have precluded the development of multi-day activity-travel demand models. With passive and technology-based data collection methods increasingly in vogue, the collection of multi-day travel data may become increasingly commonplace in the years ahead. This paper addresses the methodological challenge associated with modeling multi-day activity-travel demand by formulating a multivariate multiple discrete-continuous probit (MDCP) model system. The comprehensive framework ties together two MDCP model components, one corresponding to weekday time allocation and the other to weekend activity-time allocation. By tying the two MDCP components together, the model system also captures relationships in activity-time allocation between weekdays on the one hand and weekend days on the other. Model estimation on a week-long travel diary data set from the United Kingdom shows that there are significant inter-relationships between weekdays and weekend days in activity-travel scheduling behavior. The model system presented in this paper may serve as a higher-level multi-day activity scheduler in conjunction with existing daily activity-based travel models.},

	abstract = {This article presents the MOBIS dataset and underlying survey methods used in its collection. The MOBIS study was a nation-wide randomised controlled trial (RCT) of transport pricing in Switzerland, utilising a combination of postal recruitment, online surveys, and GPS tracking. 21,571 persons completed the first online survey, and 3680 persons completed 8 weeks of GPS tracking. Many continued tracking for over a year after the study was completed. In the field experiment, participants participated through the use of a GPS tracking app, Catch-my-Day, which logged their daily travel on different transport modes and imputed the trip segments and modes. The experiment lasted 8 weeks, bookended by two online surveys. After the first 4-week control phase, participants were split into two different treatment groups and a continued control group. An analysis of the survey participation shows that the technology is capable of supporting such an experiment on both Android and iOS, the two main mobile platforms. Significant differences in the engagement and attrition were observed between iOS and Android participants over the 8-week period. Finally, the attrition rate did not vary between treatment groups. This paper also reports on the wealth of data that are being made available for further research, which includes over 3 million trip stages and activities, labelled with transport mode and purpose respectively.},

We show that, for one given prior over states, RI choice probabilities may take the form of any additive random utility discrete choice model (ARUM) when the information cost is a Bregman information, a class defined in this article. The prior information of the rationally inattentive agent is summarized in a constant vector of utilities in the corresponding ARUM.},

@inproceedings{Miller:2020aa,
	abstract = {This chapter discusses the need for the next generation of travel demand models. Tracing the origins of the IATBR from its first conference, many advances in travel demand modeling have occurred, notably the widespread adoption of random utility-based modeling methods, increasing implementation of activity-based (or, more typically, tour-based) models, and acceptance of microsimulation (in many quarters at least) as a practical computational approach for dealing with disaggregate, heterogeneous trip-makers. We are now in an era where the transportation field is being disrupted in ways that have not been experienced during the past 100 years. Not only are these disruptions fundamentally changing our transportation systems, but they are also posing new and very difficult challenges to even the best of our current travel demand models. Indeed, the basic premise of this chapter is that our current models are inadequate to analyze this ``brave new world''of new technologies and services. The policy needed to be able to model and evaluate these disruptions, however, is great. Thus, it is urgently required to develop and test new travel demand models that are capable of credibly dealing with this emerging new world and to help guide policies that will ensure that these coming changes will, in fact, result in more equitable and sustainable urban regions, rather than the reverse. Section 2 of this chapter briefly discusses a few of these key disruptions and some of the challenges that they pose to the current travel demand modeling state of practice/art. To frame the discussion of travel demand modeling R\&D needs to address these challenges, Section 3 defines the ``four pillars''of modeling. Based on these four pillars, four ``provocations''concerning modeling challenges and needs are introduced that are then discussed in detail in Sections 4--7, respectively. Section 8, concludes the chapter by summarizing the preceding discussions in terms of recommendations concerning key steps that need to be taken toward development of a next generation of advanced travel demand models. Taking these steps will, indeed, require bold actions that, if successful, will take us into new policy analysis and modeling territories.},

	abstract = {While computer simulation gained importance as a technique for generating knowledge in various research disciplines, the size of simulation models representing real world scenarios is growing, too. In Social Simulation, e.g., there is a need to simulate a large number of humans using individual software agents for generating and analyzing human-like behavior in artificial societies. Nowadays, a variety of toolkits and frameworks exists providing functionalities for supporting implementation and execution of simulation experiments. Yet, the choice of a suitable framework is difficult as unforeseen scalability issues may arise when extending agent models. Therefore, this paper aims at providing a method for analyzing and comparing agent-based simulation frameworks regarding their ability to scale simulation models and experiments. Based on performance metrics, standardized experiments are conducted while altering internal and external scaling parameters. As part of the study, four Java-based agent frameworks are analyzed and compared: Aimpulse Spectrum, JADE, MASON, and Repast.},

Recent studies have increased the complexity of their travel diaries, be it through accounting for further relevant characteristics within the diary itself or with questionnaires, all with the goal of accurately contextualizing these travel decisions. TimeUse+ is a novel tool that collects GPS tracks passively and has users actively enrich tracked events with activity and expenditure information all within the same diary app. We document all components of our flexible platform in their entirety before evaluating the data collection tool in two applications with over 200 individuals in Switzerland. We test several configurations that alter study duration, detail of activities performed, and the monetary incentive offered. Results suggest that it is reasonable to apply our framework for an extended period of four weeks, yielding rich longitudinal accounts of individuals' travel, time use, and expenditure patterns. We discuss adjustments made along the way to improve the app and accompanying materials and present initial results about how Swiss residents use their time and money. We ultimately describe limitations of the framework and outline next steps for the project.},

@article{Pinto:2020aa,
	abstract = {Outdoor air pollution was responsible for approximately 4.2 million deaths around the world in 2016, with the emissions from road vehicles being the main source of air pollution in urban areas. To fulfill the need to identify the contribution of pollutants emitted by on-road vehicles and examine the limitations of various air quality models (boundary conditions, wind behavior representations, chemical mechanisms and reactions), a systematic review of the main traffic variables used in emissions and air quality modeling was performed. The discussion of their relationships, connections, and relevance showed a consistent sequence to generate traffic data using different traffic models. A list of key traffic variables to use as input data for vehicle emissions modeling and consequently to improve the accuracy of air quality modeling was proposed. A revision over 125 published articles was realized approaching methods to integrate traffic, emissions, air quality models, and detailing how these data can improve the results generated by the air quality model. Traffic models (macroscopic, mesoscopic, and microscopic) require variables at different levels of detail, such as traffic flow, speed, fuel consumption, and fleet composition. The emissions models (static and dynamic) are the key inputs to regional air quality models, but there is a tradeoff between the accuracy in emission estimates and the level of detail in model inputs. Meteorological data also influence the results. The conclusions showed that gaps remain on consistent emissions factors, spatial and temporal distributions, allocations of emissions on grid cells, and performance of the meteorological models. The average link-based traffic parameters are a persistent limitation. The proposed key traffic variables list point to flow per vehicle type as the most important variable. There is a need for scientific efforts to integrate traffic engineering data into emissions models to improve air quality modeling results using better traffic flow representations. Uncertainties in traffic data must first be analyzed, and accordingly a guidance with an accuracy reference for distinctive applications in different regions should be proposed.},

DynaMIT is a real-time system that can be used to generate guidance for travelers. The main principle on which DynaMIT is based is that information should be consistent, and user optimal. Consistency implies that the traffic conditions experienced by the travelers are consistent with the condition assumed in generating the guidance. To generate consistent user optimal information, DynaMIT performs two main functions: state estimation and prediction. A demand simulator and a supply simulator interact to perform these tasks. A case study demonstrates the value of the system.},

The simulator is integrated because its models, inputs and outputs, simulated components, and code base are integrated within a multiscale agent- and activity-based simulation platform capable of simulating different spatiotemporal resolutions and accounting for different levels of travelers? decision making. The simulator is microscopic because both the demand (agents and its trips) and the supply (trip realization and movements on the network) are microscopic (i.e., modeled individually). Finally, the simulator has mobility because it copes with the multimodal nature of urban networks and the need for the flexible simulation of innovative transportation services, such as on-demand and smart mobility solutions. This paper follows previous publications that describe SimMobility?s overall framework and models. SimMobility is an open-source, multiscale platform that considers land use, transportation, and mobility-sensitive behavioral models. SimMobility ST aims at simulating the high-resolution movement of agents (traffic, transit, pedestrians, and goods) and the operation of different mobility services and control and information systems. This paper presents the SimMobility ST modeling framework and system architecture and reports on its successful calibration for Singapore and its use in several scenarios of innovative mobility applications. The paper also shows how detailed performance measures from SimMobility ST can be integrated with a daily activity and mobility patterns simulator. Such integration is crucial to model accurately the effect of different technologies and service operations at the urban level, as the identity and preferences of simulated agents are maintained across temporal decision scales, ensuring the consistency and accuracy of simulated accessibility and performance measures of each scenario.},

	abstract = {Scenarios provide a commonly used and intuitively appealing means to communicate and characterize uncertainty in many decision support applications, but can fall short of their potential especially when used in broad public debates among participants with diverse interests and values. This paper describes a new approach to participatory, computer-assisted scenario development that we call scenario discovery, which aims to address these challenges. The approach defines scenarios as a set of plausible future states of the world that represent vulnerabilities of proposed policies, that is, cases where a policy fails to meet its performance goals. Scenario discovery characterizes such sets by helping users to apply statistical or data-mining algorithms to databases of simulation-model-generated results in order to identify easy-to-interpret combinations of uncertain model input parameters that are highly predictive of these policy-relevant cases. The approach has already proved successful in several high impact policy studies. This paper systematically describes the scenario discovery concept and its implementation, presents statistical tests to evaluate the resulting scenarios, and demonstrates the approach on an example policy problem involving the efficacy of a proposed U.S. renewable energy standard. The paper also describes how scenario discovery appears to address several outstanding challenges faced when applying traditional scenario approaches in contentious public debates.},

	abstract = {Scenario Discovery is a widely used method in model-based decision support for identifying common input space properties across ensembles of exploratory model runs. For model runs with behavior over time, these properties are identified by reducing each run to a single value, which obscures potentially decision-relevant dynamics. We address the problem of considering dynamics in Scenario Discovery by applying time series clustering to the ensemble of model runs, and then finding the common input properties for each cluster. This separates the input space into multiple scenarios, each corresponding to a distinct model dynamic. Policy interventions can be targeted at different scenarios by analyzing overlap of these subspaces. Our work expands Scenario Discovery by improving consideration of system behavior over time, which is highly relevant for the management of complex nonlinear systems such as ecosystems or technical infrastructure.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we attempt to derive and test the role of energy prices on economic growth. We first developed a two-sector endogenous growth model, based on J Polit Economy 1991; 99:500--521. We modified the model such that consumption goods sector uses energy as an input along with capital. The model allows us to show that the growth rate of energy price has a negative effect on the growth rates of energy use and real GDP. Following this, derived theoretical relationships between energy prices and economic growth and energy consumption were tested empirically using error-correction based panel cointegration tests and panel Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) approach. We applied this methodology on data of composite energy prices, GDP per capita and energy consumption per capita for sixteen countries for the period between 1978 and 2011. We found significant cointegration between energy prices and real GDP per capita, as well as between energy prices and energy consumption per capita. Moreover, long-run estimates reveal negative and significant effects of composite energy prices on both GDP per capita and energy consumption per capita. We suggest that increasing the share of renewable energy sources in energy consumption would help policy-makers to control permanent long-term increases in consumer energy prices, in turn leading to an increase in economic growth, and hence in welfare. This paper contributes to the literature by highlighting the existence of a previously neglected welfare-improving channel of renewable energy.},

	abstract = {In this chapter, we seek to answer two questions: What does psychology know about encouraging individual and household behaviors to limit climate change, and where can psychology contribute most to climate change mitigation through future research? We argue that to meet climate change mitigation targets, psychologists need to look beyond the behaviors they have typically studied---frequent curtailment behaviors that are easy to measure---and focus on actions that have a greater impact over the long term. To guide these efforts, we present a conceptual framework that classifies individual and household behaviors by their potential to reasonably achieve emissions reductions. We then review available evidence regarding the determinants of those behaviors, identify gaps in research efforts to date, and conclude by pointing to more productive research directions for psychologists working in this area.},

I first discuss factors that affect the likelihood that individuals engage in a wide range of climate actions. Next, I review the processes through which values affect climate actions and reflect on how to motivate climate actions among people who do not strongly care about nature, the environment, and climate change. Then I explain that even people who may be motivated to engage in climate actions may not do so when they face major barriers to act. This implies that to promote wide-scale climate actions, broader system changes are needed. I discuss relevant factors that affect public support for system changes that facilitate and enable climate action. Finally, I summarize key lessons learned and identify important questions for future research.},

Many people are intrinsically motivated to engage in proenvironmental actions, because protecting the environment makes them feel good about themselves. People are more likely to be intrinsically motivated to act proenvironmentally over and again when they strongly endorse biospheric values. However, people may be less likely to act on their biospheric values when these values are not supported by the context, or when competing values are activated by factors in a choice context. Next, I discuss strategies to encourage proenvironmental actions by strengthening biospheric values, or by empowering and motivating people to act on their biospheric values.

The results of this study suggest that environmental concern and myths of nature are overlapping constructs. Moreover, it appeared that respondents differing in environmental concern (as measured by the New Environmental Paradigm Scale and myths of nature) varied substantially in their preferences for environmental management strategies. Respondents with a high environmental risk concern had higher preferences for behavioral change strategies and government regulation, whereas respondents with a low environmental risk concern had higher preferences for market-oriented solutions.

While practitioners are increasingly realising that they cannot simply ignore public emotions, they struggle with how to deal with people's emotional responses and how to secure public acceptability of sustainable energy projects. We argue that a first critical step in order to adequately address emotional responses to energy projects is to understand where these emotional responses come from. We introduce a value-based approach, which entails that different characteristics of energy projects may violate or support people's core values, which evokes emotions in people. We present a theoretical framework of the relationship between people's values, the (perceived) implications of energy projects for these values, and people's emotional responses to energy projects. We give examples from case studies in the literature to substantiate our reasoning, and we offer directions for future research. Our novel approach provides critical insights for project developers, decision makers, engineers, and scientists who aim to better understand the human dimension of a sustainable energy transition.},

The authors explore this assertion in the context of two empirical studies that investigated the role of visual, and iconic, representations of climate change for public engagement respectively. Results demonstrate that although such representations have much potential for attracting people's attention to climate change, fear is generally an ineffective tool for motivating genuine personal engagement. Nonthreatening imagery and icons that link to individuals' everyday emotions and concerns in the context of this macro-environmental issue tend to be the most engaging.

Two dimensions of trust are relevant in this respect: competence-based and integrity-based trust. Yet, the unique and interaction effects of these two dimensions of trust on project acceptability are not well understood. We conducted two experimental studies to test these effects in China and the Netherlands. As expected, higher integrity-based trust in responsible agents led to higher project acceptability in both countries. Notably, these effects were independent of the level of competence-based trust. Competence-based trust enhanced project acceptability only in China and only when integrity-based trust was low. Mediation analyses further showed that (part of) the effects of both dimensions of trust on project acceptability could be explained by people's perceptions of how the decisions were made, in both countries. Results suggest that integrity-based trust has a more profound effect on project acceptability.},

Because pro-environmental behaviors impact peoples'everyday lives, understanding this relation is critical for promoting long-term environmental solutions. Using a series of meta-analyses, we systematically reviewed the literature on the association between individuals'pro-environmental behaviors and their subjective wellbeing. We hypothesized that the relation between pro-environmental behavior and subjective wellbeing would be positive and strongest among types of behaviors (e.g. sustainable purchase decisions) and indicators of subjective wellbeing which more clearly reflect personal meaning (e.g. warm glow). We sourced studies via PsychINFO, PsychARTICLES, GreenFile, SocINDEX, Web of Science, and Scopus, as well as professional email lists, direct contact with authors who publish in this domain, data from the authorship team, and the European Social Survey (2016). We included studies with quantitative data on the relation between individuals'pro-environmental behavior and their subjective wellbeing, ultimately identifying 78 studies (73 published, 5 unpublished) for synthesis. Across multiple indicators of pro-environmental behaviors and subjective wellbeing, we found a significant, positive relation (overall r = .243), and this relation did not meaningfully differ across study characteristics (e.g. sample, design). As predicted, the relation was particularly strong for indicators of pro-environmental behavior and subjective wellbeing which clearly reflect meaning, such as sustainable purchase decisions (r = .291) and for warm glow (r = .408). We found a robust, positive relation between people's pro-environmental behaviors and subjective wellbeing, and initial evidence that this relation may be stronger the more clearly behaviors and indicators of subjective wellbeing reflect meaning. Our results indicate that program and policy-makers can seek opportunities to design `win-win'sustainability programs which could positively impact both people and the environment.},

We outline a research agenda that we see as crucial for obtaining a solid evidence base on how emotions can optimally promote sustainable behavior. This paper is meant to stimulate discussion and a coordinated research effort on how emotions may be better leveraged to promote large-scale sustainable action and to promote a stronger integration of emotional strategies into the toolbox of policy makers.},

@article{Abrahamse:2005aa,
	abstract = {This article reviews and evaluates the effectiveness of interventions aiming to encourage households to reduce energy consumption. Thirty-eight studies performed within the field of (applied) social and environmental psychology are reviewed, and categorized as involving either antecedent strategies (i.e. commitment, goal setting, information, modeling) or consequence strategies (i.e. feedback, rewards). Particular attention is given to the following evaluation criteria: (1) to what extent did the intervention result in behavioral changes and/or reductions in energy use, (2) were underlying behavioral determinants examined (e.g. knowledge, attitudes), (3) to what extent could effects be attributed to the interventions and, (4) were effects maintained over longer periods of time? Interestingly, most studies focus on voluntary behavior change, by changing individual knowledge and/or perceptions rather than changing contextual factors (i.e. pay-off structure) which may determine households'behavioral decisions. Interventions have been employed with varying degrees of success. Information tends to result in higher knowledge levels, but not necessarily in behavioral changes or energy savings. Rewards have effectively encouraged energy conservation, but with rather short-lived effects. Feedback has also proven its merits, in particular when given frequently. Some important issues cloud these conclusions, such as methodological problems. Also, little attention is given to actual environmental impact of energy savings. Often, an intervention's effectiveness is studied without examining underlying psychological determinants of energy use and energy savings. Also, it is not always clear whether effects were maintained over a longer period of time. Recommendations are given to further improve intervention planning and to enhance the effectiveness of interventions.},

@article{WangYe24,
	abstract = { This paper further explores multiple discrete-continuous extreme value (MDCEV) models. MDCEV models are widely used for time-use analysis because they can accommodate the diminishing marginal utility with respect to time consumption and benefit from simple closed-form likelihood expressions for estimation, while considering the overall constraints of time resource. However, all of the existing models adopt a monotonically increasing form of utility function, which does not accommodate possible non-monotonic utilities with respect to time-use. This paper further develops the MDCEV model by firstly introducing utility functions with a form of parabola to capture non-monotonic preferences in time allocation behaviors. A corresponding simple and computationally efficient forecasting algorithm to predict the time-use of individuals is also developed. The proposed MDCEV model with parabolic utilities is applied to analyze time-use decisions among a variety of outdoor non-mandatory activities on weekends using data from the 2019 American Time Use Survey. The proposed model is compared with traditional MDCEV models to show its ability to describe non-monotonic preferences in time-use in association with various explanatory variables. This paper makes an initial attempt to specify non-monotonic utilities for time-use analysis, but further studies are required to develop more sophisticated non-monotonic utility formulation to improve the goodness-of-fit of the model. },

The algorithms build on simple yet insightful, analytical explorations with the Karush Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of optimality that shed new light on the properties of the models. The MDCEV model and the forecasting algorithms proposed in this paper are applied to a household-level energy consumption dataset to analyze residential energy consumption patterns in the United States. Further, simulation experiments are undertaken to assess the computational performance of the proposed and existing KT demand forecasting algorithms for a range of choice situations with small and large choice sets.},

	n2 = {Among the new transportation services made possible by the introduction of automated vehicles, automated mobility-on-demand (AMoD) has attracted a lot of attention from both industry and researchers. AMoD provides a service similar to taxi or ride-sharing services, while being driverless. It is expected to attract a huge fraction of travelers currently using mass transit or private vehicles and will have a disruptive effect on urban transportation. While most studies have focused on the operational efficiency of the technology itself, our work aims to investigate its impact on urban mobility. Our contribution is two-fold. First, we present a flexible AMoD modeling and simulation framework developed within a multi-modal agent-based urban simulation platform (SimMobility). The framework allows the detailed simulation and assessment of different AMoD operations together with an activity-based framework that accounts for changes in demand, such as activity participation, trip making, mode, destination, or route choice decisions. Second, we focus our attention on the role of mass transit in a futuristic urban system where AMoD is widely available. Mass transit is already challenged by current ride-sharing services, for example, Uber and Lyft, which provide comparatively better and cheaper services. This trend will plausibly be exacerbated with the introduction of AMoD, which may indirectly act as a replacement to mass transit. Our simulation results show that mass transit is irreplaceable, despite the high efficiency of AMoD, in order to avoid congestion and maintain a sustainable urban transportation system with acceptable levels of service.},

	abstract = {Assessing and predicting car type choices are important for policy analysis. Car type choice models are often based on aggregate alternatives. This is due to the fact that analysts typically do not observe choices at the detailed level that they are made. In this paper, we use registry data of all new car purchases in Sweden for two years where cars are observed by their brand, model and fuel type. However, the choices are made at a more detailed level. Hence, an aggregate (observed) alternative can correspond to several disaggregate (detailed) alternatives. We present an extensive empirical study analyzing estimation results, in-sample and out-of-sample fit as well as prediction performance of five model specifications. These models use different aggregation methods from the literature. We propose a specification of a two-level nested logit model that captures correlation between aggregate and disaggregate alternatives. The nest specific scale parameters are defined as parameterized exponential functions to keep the number of parameters reasonable. The results show that the in-sample and out-of-sample fit as well as the prediction performance differ. The best model accounts for the heterogeneity over disaggregate alternatives as well as the correlation between both disaggregate and aggregate alternatives. It outperforms the commonly used aggregation method of simply including a size measure.},

@article{SaisGarl87,
	abstract = { Sequential spatial choices of shopping destinations in the largescale environment, entailed by multistop trip planning, have been modeled as a sequence of choices of closest locations. The validity of such modeling attempts was questioned by the results of a reported study. In a laboratory test, subjects who solved simulated trip-planning problems with one, two, or three choice sets with pairs of familiar locations were found frequently to choose in a way that total distance was minimized even though this meant that the closest location was not chosen each time. The results were similar in a field test in which subjects were taken to a downtown business district, asked to choose locations, and to walk to the chosen locations. Subjects were furthermore found to make few revisions when implementing their choices. The ability to minimize total distance probably relied on the discovery of spatial configurations of locations that appeared to presuppose a simultaneous representation of the locations, as suggested by differences in results in both the laboratory and the field tests depending on whether subjects had access to a street map or not, in the laboratory test depending on whether the locations were downtown or all over the city. },

@article{Bhat2005,
	abstract = {Several consumer demand choices are characterized by the choice of multiple alternatives simultaneously. An example of such a choice situation in activity-travel analysis is the type of discretionary (or leisure) activity to participate in and the duration of time investment of the participation. In this context, within a given temporal period (say a day or a week), an individual may decide to participate in multiple types of activities (for example, in-home social activities, out-of-home social activities, in-home recreational activities, out-of-home recreational activities, and out-of-home non-maintenance shopping activities). In this paper, we derive and formulate a utility theory-based model for discrete/continuous choice that assumes diminishing marginal utility as the level of consumption of any particular alternative increases (i.e., satiation). This assumption yields a multiple discreteness model (i.e., choice of multiple alternatives can occur simultaneously). This is in contrast to the standard discrete choice model that is based on assuming the absence of any diminishing marginal utility as the level of consumption of any alternative increases (i.e., no satiation), leading to the case of strictly single discreteness. The econometric model formulated here, which we refer to as the multiple discrete-continuous extreme value (MDCEV) model, has a surprisingly simple and elegant closed form expression for the discrete-continuous probability of not consuming certain alternatives and consuming given levels of the remaining alternatives. To our knowledge, we are the first to develop such a simple and powerful closed-form model for multiple discreteness in the literature. This formulation should constitute an important milestone in the area of multiple discreteness, just as the multinomial logit (MNL) represented an important milestone in the area of single discreteness. Further, the MDCEV model formulated here has the appealing property that it collapses to the familiar multinomial logit (MNL) choice model in the case of single discreteness. Finally, heteroscedasticity and/or correlation in unobserved characteristics affecting the demand of different alternatives can be easily incorporated within the MDCEV model framework using a mixing approach. The MDCEV model and its mixed variant are applied to analyze time-use allocation decisions among a variety of discretionary activities on weekends using data from the 2000 San Francisco Bay Area survey. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Random utility models are typically based on the assumptions that individuals exhibit compensatory behaviour and that their choice sets are pre-specified. These assumptions may be unrealistic in many practical cases; in particular, it has been argued that thresholds may be part of choice--rejection mechanisms (i.e. if the threshold of any attribute for a given alternative is surpassed the alternative is rejected) and, therefore, act as explicit criteria to determine the set of feasible alternatives. We formulate a semi-compensatory two-stage discrete choice model incorporating randomly distributed thresholds for attribute acceptance. The formulation allows us to estimate the parameters of the threshold's probability distribution; these parameters can be expressed as a function of the socio-economics characteristics of the individual and the conditions under which the choice process takes place. Applying the model to real and simulated data allowed us to conclude that if thresholds exist in the population, the use of compensatory models such as Multinomial Logit or even Mixed Logit, can lead to serious errors in model estimation and, therefore, in the computation of marginal rates of substitution such as the subjective value of time, as well as in prediction. Although the Mixed Logit model can deal with random parameters allowing to treat taste differences, we found it could not be used to accommodate non-compensatory behaviour or to represent the existence of thresholds.},

@article{Cascetta:2001aa,
	abstract = {Random utility models are undoubtedly the most used models for the simulation of transport demand. These models simulate the choice of a decision-maker among a set of feasible alternatives and their operational use requires that the analyst is able to correctly specify this choice-set for each individual. Some early applications basically ignored this problem by assuming that all decision-makers chose from the same pre-specified choice-set. This assumption may be unrealistic in many practical cases and cause significant misspecification problems (P. Stopher, Transportation Journal of ASCE 106 (1980) 427; H. Williams, J. Ortuzar, Transportation Research B 16 (1982) 167). The problem of choice-set simulation has been dealt within the literature following two basically different approaches:*simulating the perception/availability of an alternative implicitly in the choice model,*simulating the choice-set generation explicitly in a separate model. The implicit approach is more convenient from an operational point of view, while the explicit one is more appealing from a theoretical point of view. In this paper, a different approach to the modeling of availability/perception of alternatives in the context of random utility model is proposed. This approach is based on the concept of intermediate degrees of availability/perception of each alternative simulated through a model (or ``inclusion function'') which in turn is introduced in the systematic utility of standard random utility models. This model, named implicit availability/perception (IAP), may be differently specified depending on assumptions made on the joint distribution of random residuals and the way in which the average degree of availability/perception is modeled. In this paper, a possible specification of the IAP model, based on the assumption of random residual distributed as i.i. Gumbel and with the average degree of availability/perception modeled as a binomial logit, is proposed. The paper also proposes ML estimation models in two cases: in the first, only information on alternatives choices is available, while in the second, this information is complemented with others on variables related to a latent (i.e., non-observable) alternatives availability/perception degree (e.g., information on car availability of decision-maker i used as an indirect measurement of the unknown and non-observable availability/perception degree of alternative car for decision-maker i in a modal split). The proposed specification is tested on mode choice data; the calibration results are compared with those of a similar logit specification with encouraging results in terms of goodness of fit.},

	abstract = {Discrete choice models are based on the idea that each user can choose both freely and independently from other users in a given set of alternatives. But this is not the case in several situations. In particular, limitations and interactions can occur when the number of available products of one type is smaller than the total demand for this type. As a consequence, some individuals can be denied their preferred choice. We develop a methodology to address those constraints and we apply it to residential location choice, where our empirical data suggest that availability constraints may bias actual choices. The analysis provides some theoretical developments and elaborates an iterative procedure for estimating demand in the presence of capacity constraints. The empirical application relies on the location choice model developed and estimated in [A. de Palma, K. Motamedi, N. Picard, P. Waddell, A model of residential location choice with endogenous housing prices and traffic for the Paris region, European Transport, 2006] for Ile-de-France (Paris region) and generalizes it to integrate capacity constraints.},

	abstract = {Consideration set formation (CSF) is a two-stage decision process in which people first select a subset of products to consider and then evaluate and choose from the selected subset of products. CSF models typically use stated consideration or infer it from choice data probabilistically. This study explores CSF by means of eye-tracking and evaluates how measures of visual consideration compare to stated consideration. We develop a model of CSF behavior, where stated and visual consideration are embedded in the specification of the utility function. We propose three different measures of visual consideration and show that one third of respondents (∼34{\%}) use CSF behavior and that stated consideration diverges substantially from visual consideration. Surprisingly, many product types stated as not considered receive more visual attention, not less. Our findings suggest that stated consideration may be in part a measure of preferences rather than of consideration, implying concerns with endogeneity when including stated consideration data in choice models. Accounting for CSF in discrete choice analysis increases our understanding of the decision process, and can target concerns with biased estimates when analyzing data from two-stage decision processes.},

Three choice set generation methods for route choice were examined in their ability to generate relevant and heterogeneous routes: doubly stochastic generation function, breadth first search on link elimination, and branch \&amp; bound algorithm. Efficiency of the methods was evaluated for a high-resolution network by comparing the performances with four multiattribute cost functions accounting for scenic routes, dedicated cycle lanes, and road type. Data consisted of 778 bicycle trips traced by GPS and carried out by 139 persons living in the Greater Copenhagen Area, in Denmark. Results suggest that both the breadth first search on link elimination and the doubly stochastic generation function generated realistic routes, while the former outperformed in computation cost and the latter produced more heterogeneous routes.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

@article{MartAguiHurt09,
	abstract = {The traditional formulation of logit models applied to transport demand assumes a compensatory (indirect) utility function in which the consumers' strategy assumes a trade-off between attributes. Several authors have criticized this approach because it fails to recognize attribute thresholds in consumer behavior, or a more generic domain where such a compensatory strategy is contained. In this paper, a mixed strategy is proposed, which combines the compensatory strategy valid in the interior of the choice domain with cutoff factors that restrain choices to the domain edge. The proposed model combines the multinomial logit model with a binomial logit factor that represents soft cutoffs. This approach extends previous contributions in several ways and allows multiple dimensions for cutoff factors. In addition to considering individual behavior, it introduces system constraints such as capacity and inter-agent interactions (choice externalities). This extension yields a non-linear problem, which is solved by analyzing the fixed point problem. Additionally, a set of evaluation tools, a social utility of the constrained problem, and a measure of the shadow price of each constraint, are proposed.},

Despite their obvious theoretical attractiveness, activity-based approaches to understanding and predicting travel behavior have suffered from the absence of an analytical framework that unifies the complex interactions among the resource allocation decisions made by households in conducting their daily affairs outside the home, while preserving the utility-maximizing principles presumed to guide such decisions. In this paper, we develop a computationally tractable system, based on an extension and modification of some rather well-known network-based formulations in operations research, to model human dynamics in uncertain environments. The research builds on the mixed integer linear program formulation of the Household Activity Pattern Problem (HAPP) by embedding in the household activity schedule decision process a means of capturing uncertainty by introducing the dynamics of rescheduling.},

@article{Tsoleridis:2023aa,
	abstract = {Understanding the constraints that individuals face during their spatial choices is important from a policy perspective. Such constraints, however, are often overlooked in the choice set generation process during model development. In order to address that gap, the current study proposes a probabilistic choice set formation based on Manski's framework assuming that the actual choice set of an individual is latent (unobserved). Though latent class models with heterogeneous choice sets have been used previously in the context of mode and route choice, their application in the context of spatial choices have been hindered due to the inherently large choice sets making the problem computationally intractable. To address this issue, we propose to computationally simplify the problem by utilising the geography-derived notions of Activity Spaces to delineate a range of potential choice sets per individual helping us to capture both issues of spatial awareness and time-space constraints. In order to account for the latent nature of the true choice set, we propose a Latent Class Choice Modelling (LCCM) framework to allocate the individuals probabilistically into the different resulting choice sets, with each class having a different choice set and a different set of parameters. Thus the LCCM is able to capture heterogeneity in the choice sets and in the sensitivities, at the same time. The proposed LCCM framework is empirically tested on joint mode and shopping destination choices captured through a GPS smartphone application. It is compared to a base MNL model estimated on the global choice set, an LCCM capturing heterogeneity only in the sensitivities and a LCCM with latent consideration choice sets, similarly to the proposed model, but with generic parameters across classes. Our proposed specification is able to outperform all of the remaining models, while also providing insights on the factors affecting individuals to be constrained in their location choices across space hinting to cases of spatial cognition, the importance of the home and workplace geography and the individual's socioeconomic status. Such insights can be important for developing more behaviourally realistic models that can be used by planners and policy makers to formulate more effective measures that better relate to the underlying population. Furthermore, the analysis provides insights into the discrepancies that can emerge by accounting for latent consideration sets in willingness-to-pay measures and demand elasticities, which could have significant implications in the effectiveness of policy measures.},

@article{Adler1979,
	abstract = {This paper addresses the theoretical and empirical issues involved in modeling complex travel patterns. Existing models have the shortcoming of not representing the interdependencies among trip links in trip chains with multiple non-home stops. A theoretical model based on utility theory and explicitly accounting for the trade-offs involved in the choice of multiple-stop chains is developed. Using this theoretical model, utility maximizing conditions for a household's choice of a daily travel pattern are derived. The optimum travel pattern is described in terms of the number of chairs (tours) traveled on a given day and in terms of the number of stops (sojourns) made on each of those chains. For a given household, the form of the optimum pattern is a function of the transportation expenditures (time, cost) required to reach potential destinations. Constraints on the conditions of optimality due to the limited and discrete nature of travel pattern alternatives are also considered. Parameters of the general utility function were estimated empirically using actual travel data derived from a home interview survey taken in Washington, D.C. The multinomial logit model is used to relate utility scores for the alternative travel patterns to choice probabilities. The resulting parameter estimates agree with theoretical expectations and with empirical results obtained in other studies. In order to demonstrate the empirical and theoretical implications of the model, forecasts for various transportation policies (e.g., gasoline price increases, transit fare reductions), as made by this model and by other less complex models, are compared. The results of these comparisons indicate the need for expanding the scope of existing travel forecasting models to explicit considerations of trip chaining behavior.},

@article{Allahviranloo2018,
	abstract = {The choice of `dining out with friends' or `wrapping up unfinished tasks at work' depends on the utility/satisfaction gained from performing each activity while being constrained by time and physical resources. In fact, such parameters as `type' `time of day' `duration' `location' `companionship' and etc. are defining factors in quantifying the utility of activities - a challenging problem which has been the focus of research for many years. This paper proposes a methodology to estimate the parameters of utility distributions for joint and solo activities, along with the penalty values associated with the deviation of activity start time and duration from their modal values. The study utilizes travel survey data collected in Frauenfeld, Switzerland, over the period of six weeks in 2003. The proposed model is a bi-level optimization model, where the upper level maximizes the accuracy of the activity scheduling on the aggregate level and is measured using the outputs of lower level optimization models. Each lower level model is a variation of pickup and delivery problem and schedules activities for each individual in the population using the parameters of utility distribution and penalty values generated by the Genetic Algorithm. The results indicate that travelers are trying to be more consistent with their arrival time to work, school and pickup/drop off activities: the associated penalty values for deviation from the modal value for arrival time to work and school activities are high. Additionally, significant differences in the parameters of the estimated utility distribution for joint and solo activities are observed, reflecting the fact that utility gained from joint and solo activities are different and needs more in-depth investigation. The proposed methodology has the potential to be applied to any multiday travel survey data, which due to advances made in handheld smart devices and mobile applications are becoming more convenient to collect.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we develop a model of activity generation for a multi-day planning period that takes within-household interactions between individuals into account. The model is based on the theoretical framework we proposed in earlier work which assumes that utilities of activities are a dynamic function of needs of individuals at person and household levels. In the model, individuals use a utility-of-time threshold parameter to decide when to include an activity in their agenda. The threshold represents a personal perception of time pressure and is continuously adapted based on learning. In an exchange phase, the individuals (re-)allocate household tasks based on a negotiation protocol with the aim of improving the group result. The model takes into account day-varying time-budgets of individuals, influences of perception, selfishness-altruism, joint activity participation and competences of individuals to satisfy particular needs. We illustrate the model by means of simulations and suggest ways for future research. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Bernardo2015a,
	abstract = {This paper examines the time-use patterns of adults in dual-earner households with and without children as a function of several individual and household socio-demographics and employment characteristics. A disaggregate activity purpose classification including both in-home and out-of-home activity pursuits is used because of the travel demand relevance of out-of-home pursuits, as well as to examine both mobility-related and general time-use related social exclusion and time poverty issues. The study uses the Nested Multiple Discrete Continuous Extreme Value (MDCNEV) model, which recognizes that time-decisions entail the choice of participating in one or more activity purposes along with the amount of time to invest in each chosen activity purpose, and allows generic correlation structures to account for common unobserved factors that might impact the choice of multiple alternatives. The 2010 American Time Use Survey (ATUS) data is used for the empirical analysis. A major finding of the study is that the presence of a child in dual-earner households not only leads to a reduction in in-home non-work activity participation (excluding child care activities) but also a substantially larger decrease in out-of-home non-work activity participation (excluding child care and shopping activities), suggesting a higher level of mobility-related social exclusion relative to overall time-use social exclusion. To summarize, the results in the paper underscore the importance of considering household structure in activity-based travel demand models, as well as re-designing work policies in the United States to facilitate a reduction in work-family conflict in dual-earner families.},

The model is estimated on a sample obtained from the post census regional household travel survey conducted by the South California Association of Governments in the year 2000. A host of household, individual, and residential neighborhood accessibility measures are used as explanatory variables. The results reveal that, in addition to household and individual demographics, the built environment of the home zone also impacts the activity participation levels and durations of households. A validation exercise is undertaken to evaluate the ability of the proposed model to predict participation levels and durations. In addition to providing richness in behavioral detail, the model can be easily embedded in an activity-based microsimulation framework and is computationally efficient as it obviates the need for several hierarchical sub-models typically used in extant activity-based systems to generate activity patterns. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

	abstract = {Traditional multiple discrete--continuous (MDC) models generally predict the continuous consumption quantity component reasonably component well, but not necessarily the discrete choice component. In this paper, we propose, for the first time, a new flexible closed-form MDCEV model that breaks the tight linkage between the discrete and continuous choice dimensions of the traditional MDC models. We do so by (1) employing a linear utility function of consumption for the first outside good (which removes the continuous consumption quantity of the outside good from the discrete consumption decision, and also helps in forecasting), and (2) using separate baseline utilities for the discrete and continuous consumption decisions. In the process of proposing our new formulation, we also revisit two issues related to the traditional MDC model. The first relates to clarification regarding the identification of the scale parameter of the error terms, and the second relates to the probability of the discrete choice component of the traditional MDC model (that is, the multivariate probability of consumption or not of the alternatives). We show why the scale parameter of the error terms is indeed estimable when a $\gamma$-profile is used, as well as show how one may develop a closed-form expression for the discrete choice consumption probability. The latter contribution also presents a methodology to estimate pure multiple discrete choice models without the need for information on the continuous consumptions. Finally, we also develop forecasting procedures for our new MDC model structure. We demonstrate an application of the proposed model to the case of time-use of individuals. In a comparative empirical assessment of the fit from the proposed model and from the traditional MDCEV models, our proposed model performs better in terms of better predicting both the discrete outcome data as well as the continuous consumptions.},

The model system represents a person's choice of activities and associated travel as an activity pattern overarching a set of tours. A tour is defined as the travel from home to one or more activity locations and back home again. The activity pattern consists of important decisions that provide overall structure for the day's activities and travel. In the prototype the activity pattern includes (a) the primary -- most important -- activity of the day, with one alternative being to remain at home for all the day's activities; (b) the type of tour for the primary activity, including the number, purpose and sequence of activity stops; and (c) the number and purpose of secondary -- additional -- tours. Tour models include the choice of time of day, destination and mode of travel, and are conditioned by the choice of activity pattern.

	abstract = {Intra-household interactions constitute an important aspect in modeling activity and travel-related decisions. Recognition of this importance has recently produced a growing body of research on various aspects of modeling intra-household interactions and group decision-making mechanisms as well as first attempts to incorporate intra-household interactions in regional travel demand models. The previously published research works were mostly focused on time allocation aspect and less on generation of activity episodes, trips, and travel tours that are necessary units for compatibility with regional travel demand models. Also, most of the approaches were limited to household heads only and did not consider explicitly the other household members as acting agents in the intra-household decision making. A model is proposed for joint choice of daily activity pattern (DAP) types for all household members that explicitly takes into account added group-wise utilities of joint participation in the same activity. The model is based on the aggregate description of individual DAP types by three main categories - mandatory travel pattern, non-mandatory travel pattern, and at-home pattern. Important intra-household interactions can be captured already at this aggregate level. A choice structure considers all possible combinations of DAPs of all household members as alternatives. Utility function of each alternative includes components corresponding to each individual DAP type as well as group-wise interaction terms that correspond to joint choice of the same pattern by several household members. Statistical analysis of intra-household interactions and estimation results of the choice model are presented. The model estimation has confirmed a strong added utility of joint choice of the same pattern for such person types as non-worker or part time worker in combination with child, two retired persons, two children, and others. The proposed model represents a part of the advanced regional model system being developed for the Atlanta Regional Commission. {\textcopyright} Springer 2005.},

@article{Calastri2020,
	abstract = {The MDCEV modelling framework has established itself as the preferred method for modelling time allocation, with data very often collected through travel or activity diaries. However, standard implementations fail to recognise the fact that many of these datasets contain information on multiple days for the same individual, with possible correlations and substitution between days. This paper discusses how the theoretical accommodation of these effects is not straightforward, especially with budget constraints at the day and multi-day level. We rely on additive utility functions where we accommodate correlation between activities at the within-day and between-day level using a mixed MDCEV model, with multivariate random distributions. We illustrate our approach using a well-known time use datasets, confirming our theoretical points and highlighting the benefits of allowing for correlation across days in terms of model fit and behavioural insights.},

@article{Carrasco2006,
	abstract = {Conceptual and empirical models of the propensity to perform social activity-travel behavior are described, which incorporate the influence of individual's social context, namely their social networks. More explicitly, the conceptual model develops the concepts of egocentric social networks, social activities, and social episodes, and defines the three sets of aspects that influence the propensity to perform social activities: individual's personal attributes, social network composition, and information and communication technology interaction with social network members. Using the structural equation modeling (SEM) technique and data recently collected in Toronto, the empirical model tests the effect of these three aspects on the propensity to perform social activities. Results suggest that the social networks framework provides useful insights into the role of physical space, social activity types, communication and information technology use, and the importance of 'with whom' the activity was performed with. Overall, explicitly incorporating social networks into the activity-travel behavior modeling framework provides a promising framework to understand social activities and key aspects of the underlying behavioral process. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2006.},

The resulting inventory-based selective household activity routing problem allows activity type choice, duration choice, activity destination choice, departure time, and scheduling of activities, all within space--time--needs constraints. A Lagrangian relaxation-based algorithm is proposed to solve the model for multiple days. A computational study is conducted. The model can measure several effects: heterogeneity in impacts of travel time changes on different days; the use of dual price as a threshold when needs play a role in the utility maximisation objectives; the possibility for activity participation consolidation due to increased travel time; and non-uniform impacts of travel time increase on utilities across a heterogeneous population. Comparison of the algorithm's performance against a commercial package showed average objective values that differed by only 1.8{\%} or less.},

The main focus of the study is the inclusion of past history of activity involvement and its influence on current activity choice. The econometric formulation adopted, explicitly accounts both for correlation across alternatives and for state dependency. The results indicate that behavioral variables are superior to socio-economic variables and that consideration of the correlation pattern over alternatives clearly improves the fit of the model. This is a first but significant contribution to changing the current static demand models into dynamic activity based ones. The availability of other multi-week travel surveys and the progress made recently on advanced econometric techniques should encourage the transferability of this study to different regions or model scale. {\textcopyright} 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

The model is an error component discrete choice model, describing individuals' choice between alternative workday activity patterns. The utility function is formulated in a flexible way, applying a bell-shaped component to represent time-of-day preferences for activities. The model was tested using a 2001 data set from the Netherlands. The estimation results suggest that time-of-day preferences and schedule delays associated with the work activity are the most important factors influencing the scheduling of the work tour. Error components included in the model suggest that there is considerable unobserved heterogeneity with respect to mode preferences and schedule delay. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Gupta2014,
	abstract = {Escorting children to school is a common travel arrangement in a household with schoolchildren. This escorting task affects travel patterns of the adult household members as accommodations are made for dropping children off at school or picking them up or doing both. Approaches to modeling joint travel arrangements between adults and children with respect to escorting have been previously suggested. However, examples of implementing such models in the framework of an operational activity-based model (ABM) are limited. This paper focuses on the explicit modeling of the escorting of children to school by adults and takes into account the possible bundling of escorting tasks in households with multiple children. The developed model is part of the regional ARM system currently being developed for the Maricopa Association of Governments in Arizona. Such a model allows for constraining the travel schedules of workers who tend to escort children on their way to and from work. Escorting has important policy implications because workers who escort children to and from school are very restricted in changing their departure times to and from work and in switching to transit; these restrictions are not evident otherwise.

	abstract = {The paper presents the results of an investigation on daily activity-travel scheduling behaviour of older people by using an advanced econometric model and a household travel survey, collected in the National Capital Region (NCR) of Canada in 2011. The activity-travel scheduling model considers a dynamic time--space constrained scheduling process. The key contribution of the paper is to reveal daily activity-travel scheduling behaviour through a comprehensive econometric framework. The resulting empirical model reveals many behavioural details. These include the role that income plays in moderating out-of-home time expenditure choices of older people. Older people in the highest and lowest income categories tend to have lower variations in time expenditure choices than those in middle-income categories. Overall, the time expenditure choices become more stable with increasing age, indicating that longer activity durations and lower activity frequency become more prevalent with increasing age. Daily activity type and location choices reveal a clear random utility-maximizing rational behaviour of older people. It is clear that increasing spatial accessibility to various activity locations is a crucial factor in defining daily out-of-home activity participation of older people. It is also clear that the diversity of out-of-home activity type choices reduces with increasing age and older people are more sensitive to auto travel time than to transit or non-motorized travel time.},

	abstract = {A component of work and non-work travel may be plausibly explained$\backslash$nby the need for individuals to be co-present in order socially interact.$\backslash$nSuccessful socializing requires maintaining and exploiting relationships,$\backslash$nfulfilling obligations, and perhaps optimization of contacts. A social$\backslash$nnetwork is a way to map relationships and to quantify conduits of$\backslash$ninformation, services, opportunity, and power. People must be able$\backslash$nto navigate both their relationships and physical space in order$\backslash$nto find other people and facilities which can provide the services$\backslash$nthey need. The result is that travel behavior and social structures$\backslash$naffect each other. This research examines hypotheses of the interactions$\backslash$nbetween social networks and trip generation. Models of social networks$\backslash$nshould be used by planners if their effects are significant and distinguishable$\backslash$nfrom factors currently incorporated into transportation models. A$\backslash$nmulti-agent-based network evolution model is presented in which social$\backslash$nvisits are generated by a set of attraction parameters which include$\backslash$nagent attributes, travel impedance, and descriptors of the actors'$\backslash$nposition in the social network topology. The trips are constrained$\backslash$nby the agent's travel budget, and dynamic equilibrium is maintained$\backslash$nby removing or weakening old links. The destination choice is thus$\backslash$na tradeoff between cost and the need for co-presence, marked by correlations$\backslash$nbetween actors in the changing social network. The interactions are$\backslash$nmonitored using a statistical toolbox from social network analysis$\backslash$nand placed in the context of findings from network science literature$\backslash$non network evolution, as well as from empirical work in sociology$\backslash$non real social networks. The behavior model used for social networking$\backslash$nis described, and results from an ensemble run are presented. A sample$\backslash$ncase of a transportation ``improvement'' is also presented, to illustrate$\backslash$nthe way in which the social network adapts to changes in transportation$\backslash$ncosts that ease spatial searches},

	abstract = {Activity schedules are an important input for travel demand models. This paper presents a model to generate activity schedules for one week. The approach, called actiTopp, is based on the concept of utility-based regression models and stepwise modeling. In contrast to most of the existing models, actiTopp covers the time period of one week. Few models have covered one week; thus, the activity generation approach of this simulation period is rare. Analysis of weekly activity behavior shows stability between different days (e.g., working durations). Hence, the model explicitly takes these aspects into account, for example, by defining time budgets to spread durations within the week. For model estimation, the study used data from the German Mobility Panel (MOP). This annual survey collects representative data on the travel behavior of the German population. The data from 2004-2013 provide more than 17,500 activity schedules for one week, with more than 450,000 activities. Selected results are shown for the model application to 2014 MOP data, which the study used for validation purposes. The mean value of activities per person and week show a difference of 0.3 activity. To evaluate the model, the study used Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests with a significance level of = 0.001. For the activity type distribution of the 2014 sample, the analysis could not reject the null hypothesis of equality of the distribution of the model and the survey data at this significance level.},

However, a comprehensive conceptual structure to understand the technological relations between goods consumption and the assignment of time to activities is still lacking. In this paper the problem is reviewed and all possible relations between goods and time are re-formulated. Two general functions are defined and proposed to account for all these relations, forming a new taxonomy for the technical constraints. The resulting consumer behaviour model is used to obtain general expressions for both the value of saving time in constrained activities like travel, and the value of leisure.},

	abstract = {Activity conflict resolution as the core of scheduling process in activity-based modeling is a challenging step because the activity diary databases mostly report the outcome of the scheduling decisions and often fail to capture key factors influencing the resolution process itself. Consequently, most activity-based frameworks ignore modeling this process by using either predefined set of activity patterns or priority-based assumptions to schedule daily activities and prevent conflict occasions. ADAPTS is one of the few activity-based models that attempts to simulate the process of activity scheduling and resolve the conflicts as they occur. This paper advances the current rule-based conflict resolution model of ADAPTS by implementing an advanced and flexible non-linear optimization model. A set of linear optimization sub-models is then proposed that together perform the same task as the non-linear model, however they are much easier to implement and maintain, while fast to run and flexible to extend. The proposed approach defines an objective function, which aims to minimize the extent of changes in timing and duration of conflicting activities, while fitting them in the schedule. Comparing performance of the proposed model with TASHA scheduler and former resolution module of ADAPTS using CHASE scheduling process data reveals significant improvement in fitting the newly planned activities in the schedules with the minimal modifications in the timing and duration of activities.},

A dynamic programming algorithm, developed for PDPTW, is adapted to handle a potentially sizable number of candidate locations. It is shown to be efficient for HAPP and LSP-HAPP applications. The algorithm is extended to keep arrival times as functions for mathematical programming formulations of activity-based travel models that often have time variables in the objective. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

In this paper, an analysis of retired and dual-earner couples is conducted to investigate how retirement would change their activity time use and patterns. In particular, intra-household interactions are considered, to explore the interdependencies among household members' choices, social-demographics and travel behaviours. Household survey data from Hong Kong are employed. Results show that retirement would substantially increase joint participations and durations in various out-of-home activities. In addition, the importance of walkability is emphasised for retired couples in a mixed-land-use and transit-dependent city, and a potential social exclusion issue is identified for the low-income retired population. Scenarios analyses including changes of built environment and lifestyles (e.g., telecommuting, online shopping and food delivery) are conducted, to investigate how couples would reallocate the saved travel time. In summary, this paper highlights the importance of considering the group decision mechanism in a household for activity generation and travel demand forecasting. It sheds light on policies to improve quality-of-life for couples before and after the retirement.},

Activity types considered are 15 generic categories of non-skeletal and flexible activities. Under the daily time budget and non-negativity of participation rate constraints, the models predict optimal sets of frequencies of the activities under consideration (given the average duration of each activity type). The daily time budget considers at-home basic needs and night sleep activities together as a composite activity. The concept of composite activity ensures the dynamics and continuity of time allocation and activity/travel behaviour by encapsulating altogether the activity types that are not of our direct interest in travel demand modelling. Workers' total working hours (skeletal activity and not a part of the non-skeletal activity time budget) are considered as a variable in the models to accommodate the scheduling effects inside the generation model of non-skeletal activities. Incorporation of previous day's total executed activities as variables introduces day-to-day dynamics into the activity program generation models. The possibility of zero frequency of any specific activity under consideration is ensured by the Kuhn-Tucker optimality conditions used for formulating the model structure. Models use the concept of random utility maximization approach to derive activity program set. Estimations of the empirical models are done using the 2002-2003 CHASE survey data set collected in Toronto. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media, LLC. 2008.},

	abstract = {This article presents an econometric modelling framework for activity-agenda formation. The activity-agenda is referred to the collection of different types of activities that are to be scheduled within a specific time period (time budget). The concept of activity utility is used to model frequencies of all individual activity types under consideration within a specific time budget constraint. Contrary to univariate modelling approach for individual activity types separately, this approach deals with all activity types together in a unified econometric modelling framework. The specification of the model also ensures the scope for unplanned (or not defined a priori) activities within the time budget. Kuhn-Tucker optimality condition is used to ensure the probability of having zero frequency of any specific activity type. Each individual activity-specific utility has two components: baseline utility and additional utility. The logarithmic function of additional utility ensures the satiation effect with increasing frequency. The heterogeneity in activity behaviour is also considered by incorporating error correlation in baseline utility. Data from the 2002-2003 CHASE survey, collected in Toronto are used to test the model specifications. Application of this modelling framework in an activity-based travel demand model will greatly enhance behavioural validity as well as sensitivity to subtle transportation policies of travel demand models. {\textcopyright} 2009 Hong Kong Society for Transportation Studies Limited.},

	abstract = {The paper presents a modeling framework for dynamic activity scheduling. The modeling framework considers random utility maximization (RUM) assumption for its components in order to capture the joint activity type, location and continuous time expenditure choice tradeoffs over the course of the day. The dynamics of activity scheduling process are modeled by considering the history of activity participation as well as changes in time budget availability over the day. For empirical application, the model is estimated for weekend activity scheduling using a dataset (CHASE) collected in Toronto in 2002-2003. The data set classifies activities into nine general categories. For the empirical model of a 24-h weekend activity scheduling, only activity type and time expenditure choices are considered. The estimated empirical model captures many behavioral details and gives a high degree of fit to the observed weekend scheduling patterns. Some examples of such behavioral details are the effects of time of the day on activity type choice for scheduling and on the corresponding time expenditure; the effects of travel time requirements on activity type choice for scheduling and on the corresponding time expenditure, etc. Among many other findings, the empirical model reveals that on the weekend the utility of scheduling Recreational activities for later in the day and over a longer duration of time is high. It also reveals that on the weekend, Social activity scheduling is not affected by travel time requirements, but longer travel time requirements typically lead to longer-duration social activities. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

Drawing upon the theory of externalities and the sociological notion of social networks, we develop a discrete choice model that incorporates elements of social influence in addition to more conventional factors such as the attributes of alternatives and the characteristics of decisionmakers. Using simulation, we apply the model to the case of telecommuting - that is, the decision to telecommute or not - over two waves. The experiment suggests that some marginal adopters of telecommuting are influenced heavily in the second wave by the decisions of others in the first wave. Furthermore, the example illustrates the importance of social influence on new adopters of telecommuting in the second wave. {\textcopyright} 2007 a Pion publication printed in Great Britain.},

@article{Srinivasan2002,
	abstract = {Previous work with data from the Boston Metropolitan Area has suggested that land use characteristics can have measurable impacts on travel behavior such as trip linking and mode choice at the individual level. However, trip planning, especially in households with children or more than one worker, is quite possibly done at the household level. In this paper, we begin to understand the travel behavior choices of households and understand the relationship of these choices with socio-economic characteristics as well as spatial characteristics of the places where the household resides, works and travels through. The results of preliminary models estimated indicate that the travel behavior of a household is indeed related to the household's residential location. The models estimated are not for the purposes of travel demand forecasting as in the case of the household based Stockholm models. The results do indicate if land use, network and accessibility characteristics also affect household trip linking and mode choice and their relationship to residential choice. Thus, one can begin to determine whether planners can make a difference through the implementation of the ideas of neo-traditional theories in local level planning. These models should provide a starting point for further exploration of the land use and transportation linkages explored from the point of view of the more realistic unit of the household. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

@article{Wang2000,
	abstract = {Although stated preference or conjoint-based models have recently found ample application in the transportation literature, there have been no attempts to use this modeling approach to develop an activity-based model of transport demand. The development of such a model, called COBRA, is discussed. The model examines individuals' choices on activity engagement, scheduling, and stop pattern formation. The model is calibrated using experimental design data collected to examine the potential effects of several policies recently proposed in the Netherlands. The modeling results indicate that although people prefer activity schedules involving fewer home-based tours, they do not prefer the combination of all individual trips into a single home-based tour. Furthermore, it is found that individuals will change their activity engagement patterns only if government policies induce substantial changes in individuals' time availability.},

	abstract = {This paper develops a random utility based estimation framework for the Household Activity Pattern Problem (HAPP). Based on the realization that outputs of complex activity-travel decisions form a continuous pattern in space-time dimension, the estimation framework is treated as a pattern selection problem. In particular, we define a variant of HAPP that has capabilities of forecasting activity selection and durations in addition to activity sequencing. The framework is comprised of three steps, (i) choice set generation, (ii) choice set individualization and (iii) model estimation. The estimation results show that utilities for work, shopping and disutilities for travel time, time outside home, and average tour delay are found to be significant in activity-travel decision making.},

@article{Zhang2006,
	abstract = {Travel behavior models assuming individual decision-making processes have been a dominant theme in transportation studies. While the assumption that an individual can decide on all relevant aspects of some types of travel behavior may be reasonable, in many other aspects household members interact before making decisions about different activities that they perform and the time that is involved. On the other hand, different types of households may show different group decision-making mechanisms. In other words, there might exist diverse intra-household interactions during joint decision-making processes. To reflect this point, this paper aims to develop a new household time allocation model based on the iso-elastic class of social welfare function, which can include different types of household utility functions as special cases (e.g., Nash, utilitarianism, autocratic and max-min types). Throughout this empirical analysis, which uses an activity diary data collected in a depopulated region of Japan, the effectiveness of the proposed model is confirmed. Furthermore, the model's applicability in evaluating transportation policies for elderly people is examined based on a simulation analysis. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Zhang2021,
	abstract = {Interpersonal and intrapersonal variabilities are two important perspectives to understand daily travel behaviors, while only a small number of studies incorporate them for understanding human dynamics. This paper employed a network analysis approach to detecting daily activity-travel patterns of 680 Beijing's residents within a week and then used a multilevel multinomial logit model to analyze the intrapersonal variability in patterns and the socioeconomic linkages behind them. Results suggest that most activity-travel patterns have significant day-to-day intrapersonal and interpersonal variabilities. This suggests that the application of a typical day of activity-travel behaviors to measure and represent a week's or even longer-term behaviors may be biased, due to the existence of day-to-day intrapersonal variability. This study also provides a hint for the selection of days of a week to conduct a diary survey for activity pattern mining or travel demand modeling.},

@article{Molloy2022,
	abstract = {This article presents the MOBIS dataset and underlying survey methods used in its collection. The MOBIS study was a nation-wide randomised controlled trial (RCT) of transport pricing in Switzerland, utilising a combination of postal recruitment, online surveys, and GPS tracking. 21,571 persons completed the first online survey, and 3680 persons completed 8 weeks of GPS tracking. Many continued tracking for over a year after the study was completed. In the field experiment, participants participated through the use of a GPS tracking app, Catch-my-Day, which logged their daily travel on different transport modes and imputed the trip segments and modes. The experiment lasted 8 weeks, bookended by two online surveys. After the first 4-week control phase, participants were split into two different treatment groups and a continued control group. An analysis of the survey participation shows that the technology is capable of supporting such an experiment on both Android and iOS, the two main mobile platforms. Significant differences in the engagement and attrition were observed between iOS and Android participants over the 8-week period. Finally, the attrition rate did not vary between treatment groups. This paper also reports on the wealth of data that are being made available for further research, which includes over 3 million trip stages and activities, labelled with transport mode and purpose respectively.},

Research aims include explaining the structural and dynamic characteristics of populations, and the implications of these characteristics for dynamic processes such as the spread of disease, opinions and social norms.  Policy makers planning for the future economic, healthcare or infrastructure needs of a population want to be able to evaluate the possible effects of their policies.  In both cases, it is desirable that the structure and dynamic behaviour of synthetic populations be statistically congruent to that of real populations.  Here, we present a parsimonious individual-based model for generating synthetic population dynamics that focuses on the effects that demographic change have on the structure and composition of households.},

Data concerning the attributes of social agents, which compose synthetic populations, are particularly important but usually difficult to collect and therefore use in simulations. In this paper, we have reviewed state of the art methodologies and theories for building realistic synthetic populations for agent-based simulation models and practices in social simulations. We also highlight the discrepancies between theory and practice and outline the challenges in bridging this gap through a quantitative and narrative review of work published in JASSS between 2011 and 2021. Finally, we present several recommendations that could help modellers adopt best practices for 
synthetic population generation.},

	abstract = {The Gibbs sampler is an iterative algorithm used to simulate Gaussian random vectors subject to inequality constraints. This algorithm relies on the fact that the distribution of a vector component conditioned by the other components is Gaussian, the mean and variance of which are obtained by solving a kriging system. If the number of components is large, kriging is usually applied with a moving search neighborhood, but this practice can make the simulated vector not reproduce the target correlation matrix. To avoid these problems, variations of the Gibbs sampler are presented. The conditioning to inequality constraints on the vector components can be achieved by simulated annealing or by restricting the transition matrix of the iterative algorithm. Numerical experiments indicate that both approaches provide realizations that reproduce the correlation matrix of the Gaussian random vector, but some conditioning constraints may not be satisfied when using simulated annealing. On the contrary, the restriction of the transition matrix manages to satisfy all the constraints, although at the cost of a large number of iterations.},

	abstract = {Activity conflict resolution as the core of scheduling process in activity-based modeling is a challenging step because the activity diary databases mostly report the outcome of the scheduling decisions and often fail to capture key factors influencing the resolution process itself. Consequently, most activity-based frameworks ignore modeling this process by using either predefined set of activity patterns or priority-based assumptions to schedule daily activities and prevent conflict occasions. ADAPTS is one of the few activity-based models that attempts to simulate the process of activity scheduling and resolve the conflicts as they occur. This paper advances the current rule-based conflict resolution model of ADAPTS by implementing an advanced and flexible non-linear optimization model. A set of linear optimization sub-models is then proposed that together perform the same task as the non-linear model, however they are much easier to implement and maintain, while fast to run and flexible to extend. The proposed approach defines an objective function, which aims to minimize the extent of changes in timing and duration of conflicting activities, while fitting them in the schedule. Comparing performance of the proposed model with TASHA scheduler and former resolution module of ADAPTS using CHASE scheduling process data reveals significant improvement in fitting the newly planned activities in the schedules with the minimal modifications in the timing and duration of activities.},

We first characterize the sharp identification region of the model's parameters by a finite set of conditional moment inequalities. We then apply our theoretical findings to learn about households' risk preferences and choice sets from data on their deductible choices in auto collision insurance. We find that the data can be explained by expected utility theory with low levels of risk aversion and heterogeneous non-singleton choice sets, and that more than three in four households require limited choice sets to explain their deductible choices. We also provide simulation evidence on the computational tractability of our method in applications with larger feasible sets or higher-dimensional unobserved heterogeneity.},

	abstract = {The paper proposes the microscopic travel demand model continuous target-based activity planning (C-TAP) that generates multi-week schedules by means of a continuous planning approach with an open planning horizon. C-TAP introduces behavioral targets to describe people's motivation to perform activities, and it uses a planning heuristic to make on-the-fly decisions about upcoming activities. The planning heuristic bases its decisions on three aspects: a discomfort index derived from deviations from agents' past performance with regard to their behavioral targets; the effectiveness of the immediate execution; and activity execution options available in the near future. The paper reports the results of a test scenario based on an existing 6-week continuous travel diary and validates C-TAP by comparing simulation results with observed behavioral patterns along several dimensions (weekday similarities, weekday execution probabilities of activities, transition probabilities between activities, duration distributions of activities, frequency distributions of activities, execution interval distributions of activities and weekly travel probability distributions). The results show that C-TAP has the capability to reproduce observed behavior and the flexibility to introduces new behavioral patterns. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a policy sensitive approach to modeling travel behavior based on activity pattern analysis. A theoretical model of complex travel behavior is formulated on a recognition of a wide range of interdependencies associated with an individual's travel decisions in a constrained environment. Travel is viewed as input to a more basic process involving activity decisions. A fundamental tenet of this approach is that travel decisions are driven by the collection of activities that form an agenda for participation; the utility of any specific travel decision can be determined only within the context of the entire agenda. Based on the theoretical model of complex travel behavior, an operational system of models, STARCHILD (Simulation of Travel/Activity Responses to Complex Household Interactive Logistic Decisions), has been developed to examine the formation of household travel/activity patterns, and is presented in a companion paper (Recker et al., 1986).},

The method uses a genetic algorithm to estimate coefficient values of the utility function, based on a particular multidimensional sequence alignment method to deal with the nominal, discrete attributes of the activity/travel pattern (e.g., which household member performs which activity, which vehicle is used, sequencing of activities), and a time sequence alignment method to handle temporal attributes of the activity pattern (e.g., starting and ending time of each activity and/or travel).

@article{Roorda2008,
	abstract = {Not enough is known about the dynamics of activity participation and travel over time. This is partially due to the lack of longitudinal datasets that contain sufficient information to explain dynamically changing behaviour. A new panel survey database collected in Toronto, Canada, provides the opportunity to explore such dynamics. Because the panel was designed to capture activity and travel patterns on multiple days over multiple years, it is possible to identify activity/travel similarities and differences in both the short and long term. This paper uses a structural equations modelling (SEM) technique with latent variables to explore these short- and long-term dynamics. Four models are tested, that distinguish between the underlying propensity to perform activities/travel, ``next-day effects'' that relate behaviour in one day to behaviour in the next day, ``same-day effects'' which indicate substitution of out-of-home activities by type and trips by mode within a particular day. Weekday activity/travel patterns are found to be different from weekend patterns. An underlying similarity is found between a person's weekday activity/travel schedules from one year to the next, and latent ``propensity'' variables, which can be represented as a linear function of the socioeconomic characteristics of the person, are found to explain this.},

These formulations can provide an analytical framework that unifies the complex interactions among the resource allocation decisions made by households in conducting their daily affairs outside the home, while preserving the utility-maximizing principles presumed to guide such decisions. A mathematical programming formulation is developed and used to identify the similarities and differences between traditional trip-based modeling methodologies and those pertaining to an activity-based approach.

@article{Srinivasan:2002aa,
	abstract = {Previous work with data from the Boston Metropolitan Area has suggested that land use characteristics can have measurable impacts on travel behavior such as trip linking and mode choice at the individual level. However, trip planning, especially in households with children or more than one worker, is quite possibly done at the household level. In this paper, we begin to understand the travel behavior choices of households and understand the relationship of these choices with socio-economic characteristics as well as spatial characteristics of the places where the household resides, works and travels through. The results of preliminary models estimated indicate that the travel behavior of a household is indeed related to the household's residential location. The models estimated are not for the purposes of travel demand forecasting as in the case of the household based Stockholm models. The results do indicate if land use, network and accessibility characteristics also affect household trip linking and mode choice and their relationship to residential choice. Thus, one can begin to determine whether planners can make a difference through the implementation of the ideas of neo-traditional theories in local level planning. These models should provide a starting point for further exploration of the land use and transportation linkages explored from the point of view of the more realistic unit of the household.},

@article{Jiang:2022aa,
	abstract = {Geographically-explicit simulations have become crucial in understanding cities and are playing an important role in Urban Science. One such approach is that of agent-based modeling which allows us to explore how agents interact with the environment and each other (e.g., social networks), and how through such interactions aggregate patterns emerge (e.g., disease outbreaks, traffic jams). While the use of agent-based modeling has grown, one challenge remains, that of creating realistic, geographically-explicit, synthetic populations which incorporate social networks. To address this challenge, this paper presents a novel method to create a synthetic population which incorporates social networks using the New York Metro Area as a test area. To demonstrate the generalizability of our synthetic population method and data to initialize models, three different types of agent-based models are introduced to explore a variety of urban problems: traffic, disaster response, and the spread of disease. These use cases not only demonstrate how our geographically-explicit synthetic population can be easily utilized for initializing agent populations which can explore a variety of urban problems, but also show how social networks can be integrated into such populations and large-scale simulations.},

A CO algorithm using the quadratic function of population estimators is presented in this paper in order to generate a synthetic population while considering a two-fold nested structure for the individuals and households within the target areas. The baseline population in this study is generated from the confidentialised unit record files (CURFs) and 2006 Australian census tables. The dynamics of the created population is then projected over five years using a dynamic micro-simulation model for individual- and household-level demographic transitions. This projection is then compared with the 2011 Australian census. A prediction interval is provided for the population estimates obtained by the bootstrapping method, by which the variability structure of a predictor can be replicated in a bootstrap distribution.},

	abstract = {Many discrete choice contexts in transportation deal with large choice sets, including destination, route, and vehicle choices. Model estimation with large numbers of alternatives remains computationally expensive. In the context of the multinomial logit (MNL) model, limiting the number of alternatives in estimation by simple random sampling (SRS) yields consistent parameter estimates, but estimator efficiency suffers. In the context of more general models, such as the mixed MNL, limiting the number of alternatives via SRS yields biased parameter estimates. In this paper, a new, strategic sampling scheme is introduced, which draws alternatives in proportion to updated choice-probability estimates. Since such probabilities are not known a priori, the first iteration uses SRS among all available alternatives. The sampling scheme is implemented here for a variety of simulated MNL and mixed-MNL data sets, with results suggesting that the new sampling scheme provides substantial efficiency benefits. Thanks to reductions in estimation error, parameter estimates are more accurate, on average. Moreover, in the mixed MNL case, where SRS produces biased estimates (due to violation of the independence of irrelevant alternatives property), the new sampling scheme appears to effectively eliminate such biases. Finally, it appears that only a single iteration of the new strategy (following the initialization step using SRS) is needed to deliver the strategy's maximum efficiency gains.},

The approach, called actiTopp, is based on the concept of utility-based regression models and stepwise modeling. In contrast to most of the existing models, actiTopp covers the time period of one week. Few models have covered one week; thus, the activity generation approach of this simulation period is rare. Analysis of weekly activity behavior shows stability between different days (e.g., working durations). Hence, the model explicitly takes these aspects into account, for example, by defining time budgets to spread durations within the week. For model estimation, the study used data from the German Mobility Panel (MOP). This annual survey collects representative data on the travel behavior of the German population. The data from 2004?2013 provide more than 17,500 activity schedules for one week, with more than 450,000 activities. Selected results are shown for the model application to 2014 MOP data, which the study used for validation purposes. The mean value of activities per person and week show a difference of 0.3 activity. To evaluate the model, the study used Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests with a significance level of α= 0.001. For the activity type distribution of the 2014 sample, the analysis could not reject the null hypothesis of equality of the distribution of the model and the survey data at this significance level.},

The model is an error component discrete choice model, describing individuals'choice between alternative workday activity patterns. The utility function is formulated in a flexible way, applying a bell-shaped component to represent time-of-day preferences for activities. The model was tested using a 2001 data set from the Netherlands. The estimation results suggest that time-of-day preferences and schedule delays associated with the work activity are the most important factors influencing the scheduling of the work tour. Error components included in the model suggest that there is considerable unobserved heterogeneity with respect to mode preferences and schedule delay.},

To date, the conventional approach to synthesizing the base-year population has been based on the iterative proportional fitting procedure. Two issues associated with this conventional approach are discussed: the first is often termed as the zero-cell-value problem, and the second is related to the inability to control for statistical distributions of both household- and individual-level attributes. Then, a new population synthesis procedure is presented that addresses the limitations of the conventional approach. The new procedure is implemented into an operational software system and used to generate synthetic populations for the Dallas?Fort Worth area in Texas. Validation results indicate that the new procedure can produce a synthetic population that more closely represents the true population than the conventional approach can.},

This paper examines several issues associated with the MDCEV model and other extant KT multiple discrete-continuous models. Specifically, the paper proposes a new utility function form that enables clarity in the role of each parameter in the utility specification, presents identification considerations associated with both the utility functional form as well as the stochastic nature of the utility specification, extends the MDCEV model to the case of price variation across goods and to general error covariance structures, discusses the relationship between earlier KT-based multiple discrete-continuous models, and illustrates the many technical nuances and identification considerations of the multiple discrete-continuous model structure through empirical examples. The paper also highlights the technical problems associated with the stochastic specification used in the KT-based multiple discrete-continuous models formulated in recent Environmental Economics papers.},

@article{PopuBenAProu08,
	abstract = { Insights into the time-of-day preferences of individuals are crucial for accurately quantifying vehicle emissions and for understanding time-shifting behavior in response to traffic congestion and road pricing. Most urban models account for travel demand by time of day by using fixed factors or by incorporating the choice among aggregate time periods such as a.m., p.m., and off-peak. These methods are inadequate for examining traveler response to congestion mitigation strategies. To address some of these concerns, FHWA recently conducted a research project to develop innovative methods of modeling travel by time of day. This paper extends the FHWA methodology to the Tel Aviv tour-based model system that Cambridge Systematics is currently developing for Israel's Ministry of Transport. The purpose of this paper is threefold: first, it discusses the modeling framework used in Tel Aviv; second, it describes the data inputs required for modeling time-of-day decisions; and finally, it describes the model estimation procedure and empirical results from Tel Aviv. The main features of the modeling approach include using half-hour time intervals, accounting for schedule delay in the absence of desired arrival and departure time data, and modeling the 24-h cycle. This paper serves as a proof of concept for the FHWA methodology and demonstrates that using the commonly available household survey data and some basic level-of-service data makes it possible to develop time-of-day models that are more detailed and better suited for policy testing. },

	abstract = { Understanding the variations in travel by time of day is essential to predicting transportation system performance and air quality impacts of the transportation sector. As tour- and activity-based modeling procedures become more commonplace, the need for accurate time-of-day modeling procedures that are sensitive to changes in policies or travel conditions, such as congestion, that affect time-of-day choices, is clear. FHWA recently conducted a research project to develop new methods of modeling travel by time of day that are sensitive to these concerns. One of the products of this project is a time-of-day choice modeling procedure designed to be applied within tour- or activity-based travel modeling processes. This procedure was designed to be compatible with most existing tour- and activity-based models in the United States. The time-of-day choice model is estimated by using household activity survey data and transportation level-of-service information from the highway network. This procedure was tested by using the activity-based travel model for San Francisco County, California. The time-of-day modeling procedure is described, including the model estimation process, data requirements for estimation and application, and the results of the San Francisco test application. The test application included alternative scenarios designed to validate the model's sensitivity to land use, transit level of service, traffic congestion, and time-of-day pricing. },

	abstract = {Discrete choice models, like the multinomial logit (MNL), have long been recognized for their ability to capture a wide array of transport-related choice phenomena. However, a number of choices are continuous response variables (e.g., location, departure time, activity duration, and vehicle usage). This paper introduces the continuous cross-nested logit (CCNL) model. The CCNL model results from generalizing the discrete cross-nested logit (CNL) model for a continuous response variable, much like the continuous logit model emerges by generalizing the MNL. The model is formulated and shown to come from the generalized extreme value (GEV) class of models. In addition, the structure of utility correlations is presented. The model's parameters are estimated for a work-tour departure time context using Bayesian estimation techniques and San Francisco Bay Area data. Empirical results suggest model predictions that are very similar to the continuous logit, but it out-performs the continuous logit in terms of out-of-sample prediction with these data. The CCNL also allows a more flexible choice behavior to emerge. Finally, a simple welfare example is illustrated and a number of model extensions are presented.},

	abstract = {The nested logit model has been used extensively to model multi-dimensional choice situations. A drawback of the nested logit model is that it does not allow choice alternatives to share common unobserved attributes along all the dimensions characterizing the multidimensional choice context. This paper formulates a mixed multinomial logit structure that accommodates unobserved correlation across both dimensions in a two-dimensional choice context. The mixed multinomial logit structure is parsimonious in the number of parameters to be estimated and is also relatively easy to estimate using simulation methods. The mixed multinomial logit model is applied to an analysis of travel mode and departure time choice for home-based social--recreational trips using data drawn from the 1990 San Francisco Bay Area household survey. The empirical results underscore the need to capture unobserved attributes along both the mode and departure time dimensions, both for improved data fit as well as for more realistic policy evaluations of transportation control measures.},

@article{ArelDalyHessOrtu12,
	abstract = { Modeling of departure time choice has recently received renewed attention because of the increasing levels of congestion in many cities and the growing popularity of travel demand management strategies such as road pricing. Current practice for evaluation of the effectiveness of travel demand management policies usually involves incorporation of the temporal dimension into transport planning models only through fixed factors derived from origin--destination data, but this practice makes them unsuitable for use in proper prediction of demand at different times of the day. To mitigate these deficiencies, the authors argue in favor of estimation and application of specially formulated time-of-day choice models. Here the concentration is on the process used to generate a survey design that obtains data suitable for estimation of such models that will ensure both realism and simplicity in the presentation; in particular, the stated preference exercise includes dependence between attribute levels. The proposed procedure should be widely applicable and offers many improvements over current practice in the field. },

	abstract = {The reference point hypothesis of prospect theory is applied to commuters' departure time decision-making and to obtain a better understanding of how commuters use arrival time information in daily departure time choice. There are two reference points defined in this study: the earliest acceptable arrival time and the work starting time for a given commuter. An arrival is defined as an early-side arrival if the arrival time is earlier than his/her preferred arrival time, and a late-side arrival otherwise. A gain occurs when a commuter experiences an arrival time that is between his/her earliest acceptable arrival time and work starting time; this is assumed to enhance the likelihood of choosing the same departure time. Similarly, a loss is observed when the commuter experiences an arrival time which is outside that range; this is assumed to reduce the likelihood of choosing that departure time. The empirical results indicate that around 20% of commuters are likely to switch their departure times and routes and most of commuters experience gains, and that preferred arrival times of commuters tend to be near their work starting times. Most importantly, it is shown that, consistent with prospect theory, commuters react asymmetrically to gains and losses.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a continuous-time hazard duration model for urban shopping trip departure time choice. The time frame for the analysis of departure time is the entire day. The continuous-time model uses a non-parametric baseline hazard distribution, employs a non-parametric representation for the time-varying effect of covariates, and accommodates time-varying covariates. These econometric issues are important to recognize and consider in a departure time model spanning the entire day. The model also accommodates unobserved heterogeneity and recognizes the ``rounding'' of reported departure times by individuals in surveys to an integral multiple of 5 min. The continuous-time model is estimated using shopping trip data from the 1996 activity survey collected in the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area. The effects of individual and household socio-demographics, employment attributes, and trip-related characteristics on departure time choice are presented and discussed. Application of the continuous-time model to forecast temporal shifts in shopping trip-making due to changes in socio-demographic characteristics and trip-chaining behavior is demonstrated. The use of the formulation as a powerful evaluation tool to manage and influence traffic patterns through dynamic congestion pricing control schemes is also highlighted.},

This approach is to be preferred over continued investment in infrastructure given the scarcity of land in Singapore. A more efficient use of existing infrastructure could be achieved by spreading peak travel. Full utilisation of the Mass Rapid Transit will depend on changing the commuter's perception on multi mode travel in addition to using public transport. While many studies have been carried out on modal choice, research on commuter trip departure decisions have been few and remain largely least understood. This paper employs multinomial logit and simultaneous nested logit analysis to model the choice of departure time (using household data collected in Singapore in 1983). Preliminary findings show that schedule delay, travel cost, and journey time to be important influences on commuter's choice of trip departure time to work. Some difficulties are highlighted and suggestions for further research are made.},

The costs of travel include queuing time and schedule delay (time early or late for work). The frequency distribution of departure times adjusts so that in equilibrium all individuals have the same travel costs. The paper extends the previous literature by examining a coarse toll and solving for optimal capacities. The application of congestion tolls can generate efficiency gains by altering the frequency distribution of departure times. Previous estimates of the efficiency gains from congestion tolling are likely to be substantially downward-biased because they have ignored this effect.},

@article{Bhat98b,
	abstract = {Travel mode and departure time choice of urban trips are important determinants of urban travel demand and the temporal distribution of this demand. While mode choice has received substantial attention in travel demand modeling, relatively little attention has been directed toward departure time choice. Further, the work trip has been the focus of most earlier mode choice research, and almost all earlier departure time choice research. The current paper examines the joint nature of mode and departure time choice for urban shopping trips. The model formulation in the paper adopts a nested structure with mode choice at the higher level of the hierarchy and departure time choice at the lower level. A multinomial logit (MNL) form is used for modeling mode choice and an ordered generalized extreme value (OGEV) form, which recognizes the natural temporal ordering of the departure time alternatives, is adopted for departure time choice. The proposed MNL-OGEV model is applied to data obtained from the 1990 San Francisco Bay area travel survey and is found to perform better than the MNL and nested logit models. In addition, the results indicate that the MNL and nested logit models lead to biased level-of-service estimates and to inappropriate policy evaluations of transportation control measures in the current empirical context.},

@article{BHAT2005679,
	abstract = {Several consumer demand choices are characterized by the choice of multiple alternatives simultaneously. An example of such a choice situation in activity-travel analysis is the type of discretionary (or leisure) activity to participate in and the duration of time investment of the participation. In this context, within a given temporal period (say a day or a week), an individual may decide to participate in multiple types of activities (for example, in-home social activities, out-of-home social activities, in-home recreational activities, out-of-home recreational activities, and out-of-home non-maintenance shopping activities). In this paper, we derive and formulate a utility theory-based model for discrete/continuous choice that assumes diminishing marginal utility as the level of consumption of any particular alternative increases (i.e., satiation). This assumption yields a multiple discreteness model (i.e., choice of multiple alternatives can occur simultaneously). This is in contrast to the standard discrete choice model that is based on assuming the absence of any diminishing marginal utility as the level of consumption of any alternative increases (i.e., no satiation), leading to the case of strictly single discreteness. The econometric model formulated here, which we refer to as the multiple discrete--continuous extreme value (MDCEV) model, has a surprisingly simple and elegant closed form expression for the discrete--continuous probability of not consuming certain alternatives and consuming given levels of the remaining alternatives. To our knowledge, we are the first to develop such a simple and powerful closed-form model for multiple discreteness in the literature. This formulation should constitute an important milestone in the area of multiple discreteness, just as the multinomial logit (MNL) represented an important milestone in the area of single discreteness. Further, the MDCEV model formulated here has the appealing property that it collapses to the familiar multinomial logit (MNL) choice model in the case of single discreteness. Finally, heteroscedasticity and/or correlation in unobserved characteristics affecting the demand of different alternatives can be easily incorporated within the MDCEV model framework using a mixing approach. The MDCEV model and its mixed variant are applied to analyze time-use allocation decisions among a variety of discretionary activities on weekends using data from the 2000 San Francisco Bay Area survey.},

	abstract = {Demonstrates that the scheduling of activities by consumers can be explicitly modeled in a theoretically satisfactory and empirically productive way. Even in the case of urban work trips, probably one of the most tightly constrained of everyday activities, schedule shifting is found to be of quantitative importance for the understanding of urban transportation systems. It seems likely that this approach can be applied productively to other goods subject to peaked demands, including electricity, telephone service, computer services, and products with seasonal demands. In short, much of economic analysis could be profitably modified to include scheduling behaviour.-from Author},

@article{guevarainitial2018,
	abstract = {Learning-based models that capture travelers' day-to-day learning processes in repeated travel choices could benefit from ubiquitous sensors such as smartphones, which provide individual-level longitudinal data to help validate and improve such models. However, the common problem of missing initial observations in longitudinal data collection can lead to inconsistent estimates of perceived value of attributes in question, and thus inconsistent parameter estimates. In this paper, the stated problem is addressed by treating the missing observations as latent variables in an instance-based learning model that is estimated via maximum simulated likelihood (MSL). The MSL method is implemented in practice using random sampling and importance sampling. Monte Carlo experimentation based on synthetic data shows that both the MSL with random sampling (MSLrs) and MSL with importance sampling (MSLis) are effective in correcting for the endogeneity problem in that the percent error and empirical coverage of the estimators are greatly improved after the correction. Compared to the MSLrs method, the MSLis method is superior in both effectiveness and computational efficiency. Furthermore, MSLis passes a formal statistical test for the recovery of the population values up to a scale with a large number of missing observations, while MSLrs systematically fails due to the curse of dimensionality. The impacts of sampling size in MSLrs and number of high probability choice sequences in MSLis on the methods' performances are investigated the methods are applied to an experimental route-choice dataset to demonstrate their empirical application. Hausman\textendash McFadden tests show that the estimators after correction are statistically equal to the estimators of the full dataset without missing observations, confirming that the proposed methods are practical and effective for addressing the stated problem.},

Rather than attempting to obtain the joint distribution of all outcomes of the endogenous variables, I propose finding the distribution conditional on the initial value (and the observed history of strictly exogenous explanatory variables). The approach is flexible, and results in simple estimation strategies for at least three leading dynamic, nonlinear models: probit, Tobit and Poisson regression. I treat the general problem of estimating average partial effects, and show that simple estimators exist for important special cases. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

@article{Card97,
	abstract = {Two new classes of probability distributions are introduced that radically simplify the process of developing variance components structures for extreme-value and logistic distributions. When one of these new variates is added to an extreme-value (logistic) variate, the resulting distribution is also extreme value (logistic). Thus, quite complicated variance structures can be generated by recursively adding components having this new distribution, and the result will retain a marginal extreme-value (logistic) distribution. It is demonstrated that the computational simplicity of extreme-value error structures extends to the introduction of heterogeneity in duration, selection bias, limited-dependent- and qualitative-variable models. The usefulness of these new classes of distributions is illustrated with the examples of nested logit, multivariate risk, and competing risk models, where important generalizations to conventional stochastic structures are developed. The new models are shown to be computationally simpler and far more tractable than alternatives such as estimation by simulated moments. These results will be of considerable use to applied microeconomic researchers who have been hampered by computational difficulties in constructing more sophisticated estimators.},

@article{SaloBenA83,
	abstract = {The concept of life-style is becoming a major differentiating trait between population groups substituting for economic and social classes.This paper describes the utilization of the concept of life-style in the context of travel demand models. Life-style is defined as a pattern of behavior under constrained resources which conforms to the orientations an individual has toward three major `life decisions' he or she must make: (a) formation of a household (of any type), (b) participation in the labor force, and (c) orientation toward leisure.A population is classified into life-style groups based on similarity in a multivariate space. Socioeconomic and demographic variables define that space, and emphasis is put on variables which are indicative of emerging new life-styles (for example, the relative contribution of the female spouse to the household income). Cluster analysis is employed to identify the life-style groups.Models for the combinations of choice of mode and destination for shopping trips are estimated for the pooled sample and the life-style segments. Comparisons of these models with the performance of other market segmentation schemes and with the pooled model demonstrate that the life-style groups account for taste variations better than the other schemes.},

This method of simulated moments (MSM) does not require precise estimates of these probabilities for consistency and asymptotic normality, relying instead on the law of large numbers operating across observations to control simulation error, and hence can use simulations of practical size. The method is useful for models such as high-dimensional multinomial probit (MNP), where computation has restricted applications.},

	abstract = { Many consumer choice situations involve the selection of optional items or features from a menu. Often, in these situations, predesigned bundles or packages of items are also offered. We present an analytical approach to these menu situations which takes into account the large number of alternatives they represent, the interrelated nature of demand for the individual items, and the impact of bundling of items. The emphasis of our data-collection approach is on providing a realistic choice setting which represents all possible alternatives. In our modelling approach, we employ discrete choice modelling techniques which explicitly capture the full range of these alternatives. We present the results of an empirical study of enhanced custom-calling features for residential telephone service. Using this approach, we developed well-behaved choice models that were used to predict demand and revenues for the features under a wide range of marketing scenarios. },

	abstract = {The problem of obtaining consistent estimates for structural parameters in the presence of infinitely many incidental parameters was discussed first by Neyman and Scott (1948). In this paper a maximum-likelihood method based on the conditional distribution given minimal sufficient statistics for the incidental parameters is suggested. It is proved that conditional maximum-likelihood estimates in the regular case are consistent and asymptotically normally distributed with a simple asymptotic variance. The efficiency problem of this new estimator is discussed in particular with respect to some situations with ancillary information.},

	abstract = {The authors develop an approach to determine and analyze choice set restriction on the basis of secondary source information on consumer purchase histories. Individual-level choice sets are estimated using a Bayesian updating procedure in conjunction with the multinomial logit model. The authors apply the procedure to scanner panel data for the liquid laundry detergent category. An analysis of estimated choice sets across panelists reveals that market share does not "go hand-in-hand" with choice set share (the percentage of choice sets in which a brand is a member). Examining choice set membership patterns, such as the cooccurrence of brands in the same product line, also provides insight into sister-brand cannibalization. Estimation results also show that promotions can expand choice sets, providing excluded brands a means to gain entry and long-term sales benefits.},

The idea is to start with a flexible parameterization of the distribution of the explanatory variables and then rewrite the estimator to remove dependence on these parametric assumptions.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a model with polychotomous choices and
                  selectivity and then applies it to the problem of
                  estimating the returns to technical school
                  training. Using the National Longitudinal Survey
                  data set on young men the paper finds evidence of
                  self-selectivity in the high school wage equation
                  and estimates the wage effect of technical school to
                  be a \$1.27 per hour increase in wages. This amounts
                  to an estimated rate of return of 9\% to 11.2\%,
                  which is slightly higher than estimates obtained by
                  others. Without correcting for selectivity bias the
                  rate of return is underestimated by 6\%.},

Although the conceptual foundations, theory, and methodology have a long tradition, until recently an aggregate trip-based approach dominated transportation science and planning. Changes in the business and policy environment for transportation and the increasingly availability of disaggregate mobility data have led to ABA emerging as the dominant approach. This chapter reviews the ABA conceptual foundations and methodologies. ABA techniques include data-driven methods that analyze mobility data directly as well as develop inputs for ABA modeling. ABA models include econometric models, rule-based models and microsimulation/agent-based models. This chapter concludes by identifying major research frontiers in ABA.},

@article{MaiBastFrej18,
	abstract = {Fosgerau et al. (2013) recently proposed the recursive logit (RL) model for route choice problems, that can be consistently estimated and easily used for prediction without any sampling of choice sets. Its estimation however requires solving many large-scale systems of linear equations, which can be computationally costly for real data sets. We design a decomposition (DeC) method in order to reduce the number of linear systems to be solved, opening the possibility to estimate more complex RL based models, for instance mixed RL models. We test the performance of the DeC method by estimating the RL model on two networks of more than 7000 and 40,000 links, and we show that the DeC method significantly reduces the estimation time. We also use the DeC method to estimate two mixed RL specifications, one using random coefficients and one incorporating error components associated with subnetworks (Frejinger and Bierlaire 2007). The models are estimated on a real network and a cross-validation study is performed. The results suggest that the mixed RL models can be estimated in a reasonable time with the DeC method. These models yield sensible parameter estimates and the in-sample and out-of sample fits are significantly better than the RL model.},
