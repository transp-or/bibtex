@article{Srinivasan:2002aa,
	abstract = {Previous work with data from the Boston Metropolitan Area has suggested that land use characteristics can have measurable impacts on travel behavior such as trip linking and mode choice at the individual level. However, trip planning, especially in households with children or more than one worker, is quite possibly done at the household level. In this paper, we begin to understand the travel behavior choices of households and understand the relationship of these choices with socio-economic characteristics as well as spatial characteristics of the places where the household resides, works and travels through. The results of preliminary models estimated indicate that the travel behavior of a household is indeed related to the household's residential location. The models estimated are not for the purposes of travel demand forecasting as in the case of the household based Stockholm models. The results do indicate if land use, network and accessibility characteristics also affect household trip linking and mode choice and their relationship to residential choice. Thus, one can begin to determine whether planners can make a difference through the implementation of the ideas of neo-traditional theories in local level planning. These models should provide a starting point for further exploration of the land use and transportation linkages explored from the point of view of the more realistic unit of the household.},

@article{Jiang:2022aa,
	abstract = {Geographically-explicit simulations have become crucial in understanding cities and are playing an important role in Urban Science. One such approach is that of agent-based modeling which allows us to explore how agents interact with the environment and each other (e.g., social networks), and how through such interactions aggregate patterns emerge (e.g., disease outbreaks, traffic jams). While the use of agent-based modeling has grown, one challenge remains, that of creating realistic, geographically-explicit, synthetic populations which incorporate social networks. To address this challenge, this paper presents a novel method to create a synthetic population which incorporates social networks using the New York Metro Area as a test area. To demonstrate the generalizability of our synthetic population method and data to initialize models, three different types of agent-based models are introduced to explore a variety of urban problems: traffic, disaster response, and the spread of disease. These use cases not only demonstrate how our geographically-explicit synthetic population can be easily utilized for initializing agent populations which can explore a variety of urban problems, but also show how social networks can be integrated into such populations and large-scale simulations.},

In this paper, both synthetic reconstruction (SR) and combinatorial optimisation (CO) techniques are discussed for generating a reliable synthetic population for a certain geographic region (in Australia) using aggregated- and disaggregated-level information available for such an area. A CO algorithm using the quadratic function of population estimators is presented in this paper in order to generate a synthetic population while considering a two-fold nested structure for the individuals and households within the target areas. The baseline population in this study is generated from the confidentialised unit record files (CURFs) and 2006 Australian census tables. The dynamics of the created population is then projected over five years using a dynamic micro-simulation model for individual- and household-level demographic transitions. This projection is then compared with the 2011 Australian census. A prediction interval is provided for the population estimates obtained by the bootstrapping method, by which the variability structure of a predictor can be replicated in a bootstrap distribution.},

Evaluating the effectiveness of Advanced Traveler Information Systems (ATIS) requires accurate models of how drivers choose routes based on their awareness of the roadway network and their perceptions of travel time. Many of the route choice models presented in the literature pay little attention to empirical estimation and validation procedures. In this paper, a route choice data set collected in Boston is described and the ability of several different route generation algorithms to produce paths similar to those observed in the survey is analyzed. The paper also presents estimation results of some route choice models recently developed using the data set collected.},

@article{Lemp:2012aa,
	abstract = {Many discrete choice contexts in transportation deal with large choice sets, including destination, route, and vehicle choices. Model estimation with large numbers of alternatives remains computationally expensive. In the context of the multinomial logit (MNL) model, limiting the number of alternatives in estimation by simple random sampling (SRS) yields consistent parameter estimates, but estimator efficiency suffers. In the context of more general models, such as the mixed MNL, limiting the number of alternatives via SRS yields biased parameter estimates. In this paper, a new, strategic sampling scheme is introduced, which draws alternatives in proportion to updated choice-probability estimates. Since such probabilities are not known a priori, the first iteration uses SRS among all available alternatives. The sampling scheme is implemented here for a variety of simulated MNL and mixed-MNL data sets, with results suggesting that the new sampling scheme provides substantial efficiency benefits. Thanks to reductions in estimation error, parameter estimates are more accurate, on average. Moreover, in the mixed MNL case, where SRS produces biased estimates (due to violation of the independence of irrelevant alternatives property), the new sampling scheme appears to effectively eliminate such biases. Finally, it appears that only a single iteration of the new strategy (following the initialization step using SRS) is needed to deliver the strategy's maximum efficiency gains.},

	n2 = {Activity schedules are an important input for travel demand models. This paper presents a model to generate activity schedules for one week. The approach, called actiTopp, is based on the concept of utility-based regression models and stepwise modeling. In contrast to most of the existing models, actiTopp covers the time period of one week. Few models have covered one week; thus, the activity generation approach of this simulation period is rare. Analysis of weekly activity behavior shows stability between different days (e.g., working durations). Hence, the model explicitly takes these aspects into account, for example, by defining time budgets to spread durations within the week. For model estimation, the study used data from the German Mobility Panel (MOP). This annual survey collects representative data on the travel behavior of the German population. The data from 2004?2013 provide more than 17,500 activity schedules for one week, with more than 450,000 activities. Selected results are shown for the model application to 2014 MOP data, which the study used for validation purposes. The mean value of activities per person and week show a difference of 0.3 activity. To evaluate the model, the study used Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests with a significance level of α= 0.001. For the activity type distribution of the 2014 sample, the analysis could not reject the null hypothesis of equality of the distribution of the model and the survey data at this significance level.},

	abstract = {This paper develops a model of activity and trip scheduling that combines three elements that have to date mostly been investigated in isolation: the duration of activities, the time-of-day preference for activity participation and the effect of schedule delays on the valuation of activities. The model is an error component discrete choice model, describing individuals'choice between alternative workday activity patterns. The utility function is formulated in a flexible way, applying a bell-shaped component to represent time-of-day preferences for activities. The model was tested using a 2001 data set from the Netherlands. The estimation results suggest that time-of-day preferences and schedule delays associated with the work activity are the most important factors influencing the scheduling of the work tour. Error components included in the model suggest that there is considerable unobserved heterogeneity with respect to mode preferences and schedule delay.},

To date, the conventional approach to synthesizing the base-year population has been based on the iterative proportional fitting procedure. Two issues associated with this conventional approach are discussed: the first is often termed as the zero-cell-value problem, and the second is related to the inability to control for statistical distributions of both household- and individual-level attributes. Then, a new population synthesis procedure is presented that addresses the limitations of the conventional approach. The new procedure is implemented into an operational software system and used to generate synthetic populations for the Dallas?Fort Worth area in Texas. Validation results indicate that the new procedure can produce a synthetic population that more closely represents the true population than the conventional approach can.},

@article{Tsoleridis:2023aa,
	abstract = {Understanding the constraints that individuals face during their spatial choices is important from a policy perspective. Such constraints, however, are often overlooked in the choice set generation process during model development. In order to address that gap, the current study proposes a probabilistic choice set formation based on Manski's framework assuming that the actual choice set of an individual is latent (unobserved). Though latent class models with heterogeneous choice sets have been used previously in the context of mode and route choice, their application in the context of spatial choices have been hindered due to the inherently large choice sets making the problem computationally intractable. To address this issue, we propose to computationally simplify the problem by utilising the geography-derived notions of Activity Spaces to delineate a range of potential choice sets per individual helping us to capture both issues of spatial awareness and time-space constraints. In order to account for the latent nature of the true choice set, we propose a Latent Class Choice Modelling (LCCM) framework to allocate the individuals probabilistically into the different resulting choice sets, with each class having a different choice set and a different set of parameters. Thus the LCCM is able to capture heterogeneity in the choice sets and in the sensitivities, at the same time. The proposed LCCM framework is empirically tested on joint mode and shopping destination choices captured through a GPS smartphone application. It is compared to a base MNL model estimated on the global choice set, an LCCM capturing heterogeneity only in the sensitivities and a LCCM with latent consideration choice sets, similarly to the proposed model, but with generic parameters across classes. Our proposed specification is able to outperform all of the remaining models, while also providing insights on the factors affecting individuals to be constrained in their location choices across space hinting to cases of spatial cognition, the importance of the home and workplace geography and the individual's socioeconomic status. Such insights can be important for developing more behaviourally realistic models that can be used by planners and policy makers to formulate more effective measures that better relate to the underlying population. Furthermore, the analysis provides insights into the discrepancies that can emerge by accounting for latent consideration sets in willingness-to-pay measures and demand elasticities, which could have significant implications in the effectiveness of policy measures.},

	abstract = { Insights into the time-of-day preferences of individuals are crucial for accurately quantifying vehicle emissions and for understanding time-shifting behavior in response to traffic congestion and road pricing. Most urban models account for travel demand by time of day by using fixed factors or by incorporating the choice among aggregate time periods such as a.m., p.m., and off-peak. These methods are inadequate for examining traveler response to congestion mitigation strategies. To address some of these concerns, FHWA recently conducted a research project to develop innovative methods of modeling travel by time of day. This paper extends the FHWA methodology to the Tel Aviv tour-based model system that Cambridge Systematics is currently developing for Israel's Ministry of Transport. The purpose of this paper is threefold: first, it discusses the modeling framework used in Tel Aviv; second, it describes the data inputs required for modeling time-of-day decisions; and finally, it describes the model estimation procedure and empirical results from Tel Aviv. The main features of the modeling approach include using half-hour time intervals, accounting for schedule delay in the absence of desired arrival and departure time data, and modeling the 24-h cycle. This paper serves as a proof of concept for the FHWA methodology and demonstrates that using the commonly available household survey data and some basic level-of-service data makes it possible to develop time-of-day models that are more detailed and better suited for policy testing. },

	abstract = { Understanding the variations in travel by time of day is essential to predicting transportation system performance and air quality impacts of the transportation sector. As tour- and activity-based modeling procedures become more commonplace, the need for accurate time-of-day modeling procedures that are sensitive to changes in policies or travel conditions, such as congestion, that affect time-of-day choices, is clear. FHWA recently conducted a research project to develop new methods of modeling travel by time of day that are sensitive to these concerns. One of the products of this project is a time-of-day choice modeling procedure designed to be applied within tour- or activity-based travel modeling processes. This procedure was designed to be compatible with most existing tour- and activity-based models in the United States. The time-of-day choice model is estimated by using household activity survey data and transportation level-of-service information from the highway network. This procedure was tested by using the activity-based travel model for San Francisco County, California. The time-of-day modeling procedure is described, including the model estimation process, data requirements for estimation and application, and the results of the San Francisco test application. The test application included alternative scenarios designed to validate the model's sensitivity to land use, transit level of service, traffic congestion, and time-of-day pricing. },

	abstract = {Discrete choice models, like the multinomial logit (MNL), have long been recognized for their ability to capture a wide array of transport-related choice phenomena. However, a number of choices are continuous response variables (e.g., location, departure time, activity duration, and vehicle usage). This paper introduces the continuous cross-nested logit (CCNL) model. The CCNL model results from generalizing the discrete cross-nested logit (CNL) model for a continuous response variable, much like the continuous logit model emerges by generalizing the MNL. The model is formulated and shown to come from the generalized extreme value (GEV) class of models. In addition, the structure of utility correlations is presented. The model's parameters are estimated for a work-tour departure time context using Bayesian estimation techniques and San Francisco Bay Area data. Empirical results suggest model predictions that are very similar to the continuous logit, but it out-performs the continuous logit in terms of out-of-sample prediction with these data. The CCNL also allows a more flexible choice behavior to emerge. Finally, a simple welfare example is illustrated and a number of model extensions are presented.},

A drawback of the nested logit model is that it does not allow choice alternatives to share common unobserved attributes along all the dimensions characterizing the multidimensional choice context. This paper formulates a mixed multinomial logit structure that accommodates unobserved correlation across both dimensions in a two-dimensional choice context. The mixed multinomial logit structure is parsimonious in the number of parameters to be estimated and is also relatively easy to estimate using simulation methods. The mixed multinomial logit model is applied to an analysis of travel mode and departure time choice for home-based social--recreational trips using data drawn from the 1990 San Francisco Bay Area household survey. The empirical results underscore the need to capture unobserved attributes along both the mode and departure time dimensions, both for improved data fit as well as for more realistic policy evaluations of transportation control measures.},

	abstract = { Modeling of departure time choice has recently received renewed attention because of the increasing levels of congestion in many cities and the growing popularity of travel demand management strategies such as road pricing. Current practice for evaluation of the effectiveness of travel demand management policies usually involves incorporation of the temporal dimension into transport planning models only through fixed factors derived from origin--destination data, but this practice makes them unsuitable for use in proper prediction of demand at different times of the day. To mitigate these deficiencies, the authors argue in favor of estimation and application of specially formulated time-of-day choice models. Here the concentration is on the process used to generate a survey design that obtains data suitable for estimation of such models that will ensure both realism and simplicity in the presentation; in particular, the stated preference exercise includes dependence between attribute levels. The proposed procedure should be widely applicable and offers many improvements over current practice in the field. },

	abstract = {The reference point hypothesis of prospect theory is applied to commuters' departure time decision-making and to obtain a better understanding of how commuters use arrival time information in daily departure time choice. There are two reference points defined in this study: the earliest acceptable arrival time and the work starting time for a given commuter. An arrival is defined as an early-side arrival if the arrival time is earlier than his/her preferred arrival time, and a late-side arrival otherwise. A gain occurs when a commuter experiences an arrival time that is between his/her earliest acceptable arrival time and work starting time; this is assumed to enhance the likelihood of choosing the same departure time. Similarly, a loss is observed when the commuter experiences an arrival time which is outside that range; this is assumed to reduce the likelihood of choosing that departure time. The empirical results indicate that around 20% of commuters are likely to switch their departure times and routes and most of commuters experience gains, and that preferred arrival times of commuters tend to be near their work starting times. Most importantly, it is shown that, consistent with prospect theory, commuters react asymmetrically to gains and losses.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a continuous-time hazard duration model for urban shopping trip departure time choice. The time frame for the analysis of departure time is the entire day. The continuous-time model uses a non-parametric baseline hazard distribution, employs a non-parametric representation for the time-varying effect of covariates, and accommodates time-varying covariates. These econometric issues are important to recognize and consider in a departure time model spanning the entire day. The model also accommodates unobserved heterogeneity and recognizes the ``rounding'' of reported departure times by individuals in surveys to an integral multiple of 5 min. The continuous-time model is estimated using shopping trip data from the 1996 activity survey collected in the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area. The effects of individual and household socio-demographics, employment attributes, and trip-related characteristics on departure time choice are presented and discussed. Application of the continuous-time model to forecast temporal shifts in shopping trip-making due to changes in socio-demographic characteristics and trip-chaining behavior is demonstrated. The use of the formulation as a powerful evaluation tool to manage and influence traffic patterns through dynamic congestion pricing control schemes is also highlighted.},

	abstract = {This paper provides empirical evidence to support the widely held view that institutional factors such as official work start times and staggered working hours are powerful policy tools in traffic management and in influencing travel behaviour. This approach is to be preferred over continued investment in infrastructure given the scarcity of land in Singapore. A more efficient use of existing infrastructure could be achieved by spreading peak travel. Full utilisation of the Mass Rapid Transit will depend on changing the commuter's perception on multi mode travel in addition to using public transport. While many studies have been carried out on modal choice, research on commuter trip departure decisions have been few and remain largely least understood. This paper employs multinomial logit and simultaneous nested logit analysis to model the choice of departure time (using household data collected in Singapore in 1983). Preliminary findings show that schedule delay, travel cost, and journey time to be important influences on commuter's choice of trip departure time to work. Some difficulties are highlighted and suggestions for further research are made.},

The costs of travel include queuing time and schedule delay (time early or late for work). The frequency distribution of departure times adjusts so that in equilibrium all individuals have the same travel costs. The paper extends the previous literature by examining a coarse toll and solving for optimal capacities. The application of congestion tolls can generate efficiency gains by altering the frequency distribution of departure times. Previous estimates of the efficiency gains from congestion tolling are likely to be substantially downward-biased because they have ignored this effect.},

@article{Bhat98b,
	abstract = {Travel mode and departure time choice of urban trips are important determinants of urban travel demand and the temporal distribution of this demand. While mode choice has received substantial attention in travel demand modeling, relatively little attention has been directed toward departure time choice. Further, the work trip has been the focus of most earlier mode choice research, and almost all earlier departure time choice research. The current paper examines the joint nature of mode and departure time choice for urban shopping trips. The model formulation in the paper adopts a nested structure with mode choice at the higher level of the hierarchy and departure time choice at the lower level. A multinomial logit (MNL) form is used for modeling mode choice and an ordered generalized extreme value (OGEV) form, which recognizes the natural temporal ordering of the departure time alternatives, is adopted for departure time choice. The proposed MNL-OGEV model is applied to data obtained from the 1990 San Francisco Bay area travel survey and is found to perform better than the MNL and nested logit models. In addition, the results indicate that the MNL and nested logit models lead to biased level-of-service estimates and to inappropriate policy evaluations of transportation control measures in the current empirical context.},

@article{BHAT2005679,
	abstract = {Several consumer demand choices are characterized by the choice of multiple alternatives simultaneously. An example of such a choice situation in activity-travel analysis is the type of discretionary (or leisure) activity to participate in and the duration of time investment of the participation. In this context, within a given temporal period (say a day or a week), an individual may decide to participate in multiple types of activities (for example, in-home social activities, out-of-home social activities, in-home recreational activities, out-of-home recreational activities, and out-of-home non-maintenance shopping activities). In this paper, we derive and formulate a utility theory-based model for discrete/continuous choice that assumes diminishing marginal utility as the level of consumption of any particular alternative increases (i.e., satiation). This assumption yields a multiple discreteness model (i.e., choice of multiple alternatives can occur simultaneously). This is in contrast to the standard discrete choice model that is based on assuming the absence of any diminishing marginal utility as the level of consumption of any alternative increases (i.e., no satiation), leading to the case of strictly single discreteness. The econometric model formulated here, which we refer to as the multiple discrete--continuous extreme value (MDCEV) model, has a surprisingly simple and elegant closed form expression for the discrete--continuous probability of not consuming certain alternatives and consuming given levels of the remaining alternatives. To our knowledge, we are the first to develop such a simple and powerful closed-form model for multiple discreteness in the literature. This formulation should constitute an important milestone in the area of multiple discreteness, just as the multinomial logit (MNL) represented an important milestone in the area of single discreteness. Further, the MDCEV model formulated here has the appealing property that it collapses to the familiar multinomial logit (MNL) choice model in the case of single discreteness. Finally, heteroscedasticity and/or correlation in unobserved characteristics affecting the demand of different alternatives can be easily incorporated within the MDCEV model framework using a mixing approach. The MDCEV model and its mixed variant are applied to analyze time-use allocation decisions among a variety of discretionary activities on weekends using data from the 2000 San Francisco Bay Area survey.},

Even in the case of urban work trips, probably one of the most tightly constrained of everyday activities, schedule shifting is found to be of quantitative importance for the understanding of urban transportation systems. It seems likely that this approach can be applied productively to other goods subject to peaked demands, including electricity, telephone service, computer services, and products with seasonal demands. In short, much of economic analysis could be profitably modified to include scheduling behaviour.-from Author},

	n2 = {Discrete choice modeling is a fundamental part of travel demand forecasting. To date, this field has been dominated by parametric approaches (e.g., logit models), but non-parametric approaches such as artificial neural networks (ANNs) possess much potential since choice problems can be assimilated to pattern recognition problems. In particular, ANN models are easily applicable with their higher capability to identify nonlinear relationships between inputs and designated outputs to predict choice behaviors. This article investigates the capability of four types of ANN model and compares their prediction performance with a conventional multinomial logit model (MNL) for mode choice problems. The four ANNs are: backpropagation neural networks (BPNNs), radial basis function networks (RBFNs), probabilistic neural networks (PNNs), and clustered probabilistic neural networks (CPNNs). To compare the modeling techniques, we present the algorithmic differences of each ANN technique, and we assess their prediction accuracy with a 10-fold cross-validation method. Furthermore, we assess the contribution of explanatory variables by conducting sensitivity analyses on significant variables. The results show that ANN models outperform MNL, with prediction accuracies around 80{\%} compared with 70{\%} for MNL. Moreover, PNN performs best out of all ANNs, especially to predict underrepresented modes.},

	abstract = {Conventional methods of estimating latent behaviour generally use attitudinal questions which are subjective and these survey questions may not always be available. We hypothesize that an alternative approach such as non-parametric artificial neural networks can be used for latent variable estimation through an undirected graphical models. In this study, we explore the use of generative non-parametric modelling methods to estimate latent variables from prior choice distribution without the conventional use of measurement indicators. A restricted Boltzmann machine is used to represent latent behaviour factors by analyzing the relationship information between the observed choices and explanatory variables. The algorithm is adapted for latent behaviour analysis in discrete choice scenario and we use a graphical approach to evaluate and understand the semantic meaning from estimated parameter vector values. We illustrate our methodology on a financial instrument choice dataset and perform statistical analysis on parameter sensitivity and stability. Our findings show that through non-parametric statistical tests, we can extract useful latent information on the behaviour of latent constructs through machine learning methods and present strong and significant influence on the choice process. Furthermore, our modelling framework shows robustness in input variability through sampling and validation.},

@article{guevarainitial2018,
	abstract = {Learning-based models that capture travelers' day-to-day learning processes in repeated travel choices could benefit from ubiquitous sensors such as smartphones, which provide individual-level longitudinal data to help validate and improve such models. However, the common problem of missing initial observations in longitudinal data collection can lead to inconsistent estimates of perceived value of attributes in question, and thus inconsistent parameter estimates. In this paper, the stated problem is addressed by treating the missing observations as latent variables in an instance-based learning model that is estimated via maximum simulated likelihood (MSL). The MSL method is implemented in practice using random sampling and importance sampling. Monte Carlo experimentation based on synthetic data shows that both the MSL with random sampling (MSLrs) and MSL with importance sampling (MSLis) are effective in correcting for the endogeneity problem in that the percent error and empirical coverage of the estimators are greatly improved after the correction. Compared to the MSLrs method, the MSLis method is superior in both effectiveness and computational efficiency. Furthermore, MSLis passes a formal statistical test for the recovery of the population values up to a scale with a large number of missing observations, while MSLrs systematically fails due to the curse of dimensionality. The impacts of sampling size in MSLrs and number of high probability choice sequences in MSLis on the methods' performances are investigated the methods are applied to an experimental route-choice dataset to demonstrate their empirical application. Hausman\textendash McFadden tests show that the estimators after correction are statistically equal to the estimators of the full dataset without missing observations, confirming that the proposed methods are practical and effective for addressing the stated problem.},

	abstract = {I study a simple, widely applicable approach to handling the initial conditions problem in dynamic, nonlinear unobserved effects models. Rather than attempting to obtain the joint distribution of all outcomes of the endogenous variables, I propose finding the distribution conditional on the initial value (and the observed history of strictly exogenous explanatory variables). The approach is flexible, and results in simple estimation strategies for at least three leading dynamic, nonlinear models: probit, Tobit and Poisson regression. I treat the general problem of estimating average partial effects, and show that simple estimators exist for important special cases. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

@article{Card97,
	abstract = {Two new classes of probability distributions are introduced that radically simplify the process of developing variance components structures for extreme-value and logistic distributions. When one of these new variates is added to an extreme-value (logistic) variate, the resulting distribution is also extreme value (logistic). Thus, quite complicated variance structures can be generated by recursively adding components having this new distribution, and the result will retain a marginal extreme-value (logistic) distribution. It is demonstrated that the computational simplicity of extreme-value error structures extends to the introduction of heterogeneity in duration, selection bias, limited-dependent- and qualitative-variable models. The usefulness of these new classes of distributions is illustrated with the examples of nested logit, multivariate risk, and competing risk models, where important generalizations to conventional stochastic structures are developed. The new models are shown to be computationally simpler and far more tractable than alternatives such as estimation by simulated moments. These results will be of considerable use to applied microeconomic researchers who have been hampered by computational difficulties in constructing more sophisticated estimators.},

@article{SaloBenA83,
	abstract = {The concept of life-style is becoming a major differentiating trait between population groups substituting for economic and social classes.This paper describes the utilization of the concept of life-style in the context of travel demand models. Life-style is defined as a pattern of behavior under constrained resources which conforms to the orientations an individual has toward three major `life decisions' he or she must make: (a) formation of a household (of any type), (b) participation in the labor force, and (c) orientation toward leisure.A population is classified into life-style groups based on similarity in a multivariate space. Socioeconomic and demographic variables define that space, and emphasis is put on variables which are indicative of emerging new life-styles (for example, the relative contribution of the female spouse to the household income). Cluster analysis is employed to identify the life-style groups.Models for the combinations of choice of mode and destination for shopping trips are estimated for the pooled sample and the life-style segments. Comparisons of these models with the performance of other market segmentation schemes and with the pooled model demonstrate that the life-style groups account for taste variations better than the other schemes.},

This method of simulated moments (MSM) does not require precise estimates of these probabilities for consistency and asymptotic normality, relying instead on the law of large numbers operating across observations to control simulation error, and hence can use simulations of practical size. The method is useful for models such as high-dimensional multinomial probit (MNP), where computation has restricted applications.},

@article{BenAGers98,
	abstract = { Many consumer choice situations involve the selection of optional items or features from a menu. Often, in these situations, predesigned bundles or packages of items are also offered. We present an analytical approach to these menu situations which takes into account the large number of alternatives they represent, the interrelated nature of demand for the individual items, and the impact of bundling of items. The emphasis of our data-collection approach is on providing a realistic choice setting which represents all possible alternatives. In our modelling approach, we employ discrete choice modelling techniques which explicitly capture the full range of these alternatives. We present the results of an empirical study of enhanced custom-calling features for residential telephone service. Using this approach, we developed well-behaved choice models that were used to predict demand and revenues for the features under a wide range of marketing scenarios. },

In this paper a maximum-likelihood method based on the conditional distribution given minimal sufficient statistics for the incidental parameters is suggested.

The efficiency problem of this new estimator is discussed in particular with respect to some situations with ancillary information.},

Individual-level choice sets are estimated using a Bayesian updating procedure in conjunction with the multinomial logit model. The authors apply the procedure to scanner panel data for the liquid laundry detergent category. An analysis of estimated choice sets across panelists reveals that market share does not "go hand-in-hand" with choice set share (the percentage of choice sets in which a brand is a member). Examining choice set membership patterns, such as the cooccurrence of brands in the same product line, also provides insight into sister-brand cannibalization. Estimation results also show that promotions can expand choice sets, providing excluded brands a means to gain entry and long-term sales benefits.},

@article{TrosLee84,
	abstract = {This paper presents a model with polychotomous choices and
                  selectivity and then applies it to the problem of
                  estimating the returns to technical school
                  training. Using the National Longitudinal Survey
                  data set on young men the paper finds evidence of
                  self-selectivity in the high school wage equation
                  and estimates the wage effect of technical school to
                  be a \$1.27 per hour increase in wages. This amounts
                  to an estimated rate of return of 9\% to 11.2\%,
                  which is slightly higher than estimates obtained by
                  others. Without correcting for selectivity bias the
                  rate of return is underestimated by 6\%.},

Our primary goal is to present a framework which enables one to obtain estimates of demand and cost parameters for a class of oligopolistic differentiated products markets. These estimates can be obtained using only widely available product-level and aggregate consumer-level data, and they are consistent with a structural model of equilibrium in an oligopolistic industry. When we apply the techniques developed here to the U.S. automobile market, we obtain cost and demand parameters for (essentially) all models marketed over a twenty year period.},

Changes in the business and policy environment for transportation and the increasingly availability of disaggregate mobility data have led to ABA emerging as the dominant approach. This chapter reviews the ABA conceptual foundations and methodologies. ABA techniques include data-driven methods that analyze mobility data directly as well as develop inputs for ABA modeling. ABA models include econometric models, rule-based models and microsimulation/agent-based models. This chapter concludes by identifying major research frontiers in ABA.},

	abstract = {Discrete choice models are based on the idea that each user can choose both freely and independently from other users in a given set of alternatives. But this is not the case in several situations. In particular, limitations and interactions can occur when the number of available products of one type is smaller than the total demand for this type. As a consequence, some individuals can be denied their preferred choice. We develop a methodology to address those constraints and we apply it to residential location choice, where our empirical data suggest that availability constraints may bias actual choices. The analysis provides some theoretical developments and elaborates an iterative procedure for estimating demand in the presence of capacity constraints. The empirical application relies on the location choice model developed and estimated in [A. de Palma, K. Motamedi, N. Picard, P. Waddell, A model of residential location choice with endogenous housing prices and traffic for the Paris region, European Transport, 2006] for Ile-de-France (Paris region) and generalizes it to integrate capacity constraints.},

	abstract = {The traditional formulation of logit models applied to transport demand assumes a compensatory (indirect) utility function in which the consumers' strategy assumes a trade-off between attributes. Several authors have criticized this approach because it fails to recognize attribute thresholds in consumer behavior, or a more generic domain where such a compensatory strategy is contained. In this paper, a mixed strategy is proposed, which combines the compensatory strategy valid in the interior of the choice domain with cutoff factors that restrain choices to the domain edge. The proposed model combines the multinomial logit model with a binomial logit factor that represents soft cutoffs. This approach extends previous contributions in several ways and allows multiple dimensions for cutoff factors. In addition to considering individual behavior, it introduces system constraints such as capacity and inter-agent interactions (choice externalities). This extension yields a non-linear problem, which is solved by analyzing the fixed point problem. Additionally, a set of evaluation tools, a social utility of the constrained problem, and a measure of the shadow price of each constraint, are proposed.},

In simple settings, chosen options are those that are best on a stand-alone basis. In richer settings, the consideration set can only be identified holistically. In addition to payoffs, prior beliefs impact consideration sets. Linear inequalities identify all priors consistent with each possible consideration set.}},

@article{MaiBastFrej18,
	abstract = {Fosgerau et al. (2013) recently proposed the recursive logit (RL) model for route choice problems, that can be consistently estimated and easily used for prediction without any sampling of choice sets. Its estimation however requires solving many large-scale systems of linear equations, which can be computationally costly for real data sets. We design a decomposition (DeC) method in order to reduce the number of linear systems to be solved, opening the possibility to estimate more complex RL based models, for instance mixed RL models. We test the performance of the DeC method by estimating the RL model on two networks of more than 7000 and 40,000 links, and we show that the DeC method significantly reduces the estimation time. We also use the DeC method to estimate two mixed RL specifications, one using random coefficients and one incorporating error components associated with subnetworks (Frejinger and Bierlaire 2007). The models are estimated on a real network and a cross-validation study is performed. The results suggest that the mixed RL models can be estimated in a reasonable time with the DeC method. These models yield sensible parameter estimates and the in-sample and out-of sample fits are significantly better than the RL model.},

	abstract = {This paper considers the path choice problem, formulating and discussing an econometric random utility model for the choice of path in a network with no restriction on the choice set. Starting from a dynamic specification of link choices we show that it is equivalent to a static model of the multinomial logit form but with infinitely many alternatives. The model can be consistently estimated and used for prediction in a computationally efficient way. Similarly to the path size logit model, we propose an attribute called link size that corrects utilities of overlapping paths but that is link additive. The model is applied to data recording path choices in a network with more than 3000 nodes and 7000 links.},

@article{SaisGarl87,
	abstract = { Sequential spatial choices of shopping destinations in the largescale environment, entailed by multistop trip planning, have been modeled as a sequence of choices of closest locations. The validity of such modeling attempts was questioned by the results of a reported study. In a laboratory test, subjects who solved simulated trip-planning problems with one, two, or three choice sets with pairs of familiar locations were found frequently to choose in a way that total distance was minimized even though this meant that the closest location was not chosen each time. The results were similar in a field test in which subjects were taken to a downtown business district, asked to choose locations, and to walk to the chosen locations. Subjects were furthermore found to make few revisions when implementing their choices. The ability to minimize total distance probably relied on the discovery of spatial configurations of locations that appeared to presuppose a simultaneous representation of the locations, as suggested by differences in results in both the laboratory and the field tests depending on whether subjects had access to a street map or not, in the laboratory test depending on whether the locations were downtown or all over the city. },
