	n2 = {This paper aims to develop a modeling-based framework to predict asphalt pavement field aging and its effect on the pavement remaining fatigue life. It is one of the few attempts to systematically model pavement aging and investigate the pavement?s mechanical response and fatigue life evolution with aging considerations. Two road sections in Europe were selected to develop and validate the models. First, the pavement aging model was developed based on three physical processes (heat transfer, oxygen diffusion, and oxidative reaction) of pavement field aging. The model was validated using the field measurements of pavement temperature and aging product. An energy-based viscoelastic-continuum damage material model was then developed and validated through laboratory cyclic fatigue tests. After that, the coupled field aging and viscoelastic-continuum damage pavement model were developed by coupling the two models with the time-temperature-aging shift model. The pavement model was then validated with the falling weight deflectometer measurements at different pavement service years. Finally, the remaining fatigue life predictions with and without aging considerations were conducted based on the integrated model. Results indicate that the proposed model can effectively obtain the temporal evolution and spatial distribution of pavement temperature and aging gradients. The aging-induced modulus gradient causes the localization of high von Mises stress near the road surface, which demonstrates that aging is highly associated with pavement top-down and surface cracking. Based on the case study, field aging would shorten the pavement?s remaining fatigue life by up to 1.6?years when considering only the effects of aging gradient.},

@article{Xiao:2025aa,
	abstract = {The predictive performance of probabilistic pavement condition deterioration is critical for effective maintenance and rehabilitation decisions. Currently, numerous improved models exist, but few rely on probabilistic models to improve pavement deterioration prediction. Therefore, this study proposed an improved probabilistic model for pavement deterioration prediction based on the coupling of Bayesian neural network (BNN) and cuckoo search (CS) algorithm. The model prediction performance is evaluated against two metrics: determination coefficient (R2) and standard deviation (stability). Finally, based on the data from the pavement management system in Shanxi Province, it was verified that the CS-BNN model outperforms the genetic algorithm-BNN, particle swarm optimization-BNN, and BNN models in terms of the two metrics. Sensitivity analysis further confirms the robustness of the CS-BNN model. The findings indicate that the CS-BNN model provides more reliable predictions with lower uncertainty, aiding road engineers in optimizing maintenance schedules and costs.},

	abstract = {The U.S. federal government has established goals of electrifying 50{\%} of new light-duty vehicle sales by 2030 and reducing economy-wide greenhouse gas emissions 50-52{\%} by 2030, from 2005 levels. Here we evaluate the vehicle electrification goal in the context of the economy-wide emissions goal. We use a vehicle fleet model and a life cycle emissions model to project vehicle sales, stock, and emissions. To account for state-level variability in electric vehicle adoption and electric grid emissions factors, we apply the models to each state. By 2030, greenhouse gas emissions are reduced by approximately 25{\%} (from 2005) for the light-duty vehicle fleet, primarily due to fleet turnover of conventional vehicles. By 2035, emissions reductions approach 45{\%} if both vehicle electrification and grid decarbonization goals (100{\%} by 2035) are met. To meet climate goals, the transition to electric vehicles must be accompanied by an accelerated decarbonization of the electric grid and other actions.},

	abstract = {We present a spatial Branch and Bound and spatial Branch and Benders Decomposition approach together with the Breakpoint Exact Algorithm (BEA) to tackle the uncapacitated choice-based pricing problem (CPP) where demand is captured by a discrete choice model (DCM) based on the random utility principle. We leverage problem characteristics to reformulate the state-of-the-art simulation-based formulation of the CPP as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) into a non-convex quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP), and then into a non-convex QCQP with linear objective (QCQP-L). We solve this reformulation with an efficient spatial Branch and Bound procedure utilizing the McCormick envelope for relaxations, which are then solved using Benders decomposition. We further exploit utility breakpoints to develop the BEA, which scales polynomially in the number of customers and draws, providing a fast option for low numbers of prices. Our methods are evaluated against solving the MILP, QCQP, or QCQP-L with GUROBI on a mixed logit (ML) parking space operator case study. We outspeed the MILP by several orders of magnitude when optimizing one or two prices and reduce computational time drastically for larger numbers of prices. When comparing to algorithms tailored for the CPP with ML demand specifically, our approaches significantly outperform the state of the art. Our methodology suits all choice-based optimization problems with linear-in-price utilities, given any DCM.},

@article{Yin:2018aa,
	abstract = {Along with urbanization and economic development, the number of private cars has increased rapidly in recent years in China, which contributes to concerns about traffic congestion, hard parking, energy consumption, and emissions. This study aims to investigate the joint effect of built environment and parking availability on car ownership and use based on a household travel survey conducted in Changchun, China. The binary logistic model was first employed to investigate the determinants of the car ownership in Changchun. Next, this study examined the potential impacts of the built environment and parking availability on car use for the journey to work. The result shows that built environment and parking availability can be both significantly associated with car ownership and use after controlling for the socio-economic characteristics. Moreover, in contrast with the model ignoring the parking availability, the model for car use considering the joint effect fit the data better. The results indicate that car dependency depends on the joint effect of the built environment and parking availability. These results suggest that transit-oriented urban expansion and compact land use can contribute to reducing car commuting. Meanwhile, parking restrictions at both trip start and end would be effective for sustainable transport because parking oversupply could encourage more car dependency.},

@article{Baranzini:2021aa,
	abstract = {While instruments to price congestion exist since the 1970s, less than a dozen cities around the world have a cordon or zone pricing scheme. Geneva, Switzerland, may be soon joining them. This paper builds on a detailed review of the existing schemes to identify a set of plausible design options for the Geneva congestion charge. In turn, it analyzes their acceptability, leveraging a large survey of residents of both Geneva and the surrounding areas of Switzerland and France. Our original approach combines a discrete choice experiment with randomized informational treatments. We consider an extensive set of attributes, such as perimeter, price and price modulation, use of revenues, and exemption levels and beneficiaries. The informational treatments address potential biased beliefs concerning the charge's expected effects on congestion and pollution. We find that public support depends crucially on the policy design. We identify an important demand for exemptions, which, albeit frequently used in the design of environmental taxation, is underexplored in the analysis of public support. This demand for exemptions is not motivated by efficiency reasons. It comes mostly by local residents, for local residents. Further, people show a marked preference for constant prices, even if efficiency would point to dynamic pricing based on external costs. Hence, we highlight a clear trade-off between efficiency and acceptability. However, we also show, causally, that this gap can in part be closed, with information provision. Analyzing heterogeneity, we show that preferences vary substantially with where people live and how they commute. Even so, we identify several designs that reach majority support.},

Unfortunately, there is no widely accepted general theory of respondent behaviour that explains hypothetical bias. Therefore, two meta-analyses are reviewed to test current hypotheses regarding the causes of this overstatement of WTP and the associated recommendations to mitigate the bias.

Transportation and resulting pollution have a disproportionate impact on communities that are low-income, minority, or immigrant. As a result, these communities also bear the burden of excess adverse health effects. Measurement of linkages may be difficult due to correlations between potential causal factors, including air pollution and lower socioeconomic status, but care should be taken to conduct sound studies of associations. Local context is key to understanding how disparities can change over time as populations move and adapt to the built environment. Solutions exist that can reduce inequalities and should be promoted.},

@article{Bernstein:2017aa,
	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: This pilot study tested the efficacy of a bicycling intervention targeting inactive, low-income, overweight adults on reducing perceived barriers to bicycling, increasing physical activity, and improving health. METHODS: A nonblinded 2-site randomized controlled trial was conducted in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in summer 2015. Participants included members from 1 largely Latino community and a second primarily African American neighborhood. A certified bicycling instructor led a 12-week bicycling intervention. Outcome measures including biking-related attitudes, self-reported physical activity, fitness as measured by the 6-minute step test, and biometric data were collected at baseline, 12 weeks, and 20 weeks. RESULTS: Thirty-eight participants completed the study. Barriers to bicycling declined significantly among intervention group participants at 12 weeks with some declines persisting to 20 weeks. Bicycling for leisure or non work transportation increased significantly more in the intervention than control group from baseline to 12 weeks but this difference attenuated by 20 weeks. Both groups increased their fitness between baseline and 12 weeks, with a trend towards greater gains in the bicycling intervention group. No significant change in biometric measurements was seen at either 12 weeks or 20 weeks. CONCLUSION: Despite the small study size, this bicycling intervention decreased perceived barriers to bicycling and increased bicycling activity in low-income minority participants. These findings support a larger-scale study to measure fitness and health changes from bicycling interventions.},

	n2 = {Background Active transport has great potential to increase physical activity in older adolescents (17--18 years). Therefore, a theory- and evidence-based intervention was developed aiming to promote active transport among older adolescents. The intervention aimed to influence psychosocial factors of active transport since this is the first step in order to achieve a change in behaviour. The present study aimed to examine the effect of the intervention on the following psychosocial factors: intention to use active transport after obtaining a driving licence, perceived benefits, perceived barriers, subjective norm, self-efficacy, habit and awareness towards active transport. Methods A matched control three-arm study was conducted and consisted of a pre-test post-test design with intervention and control schools in Flanders (northern part of Belgium). A lesson promoting active transport was implemented as the last lesson in the course `Driving Licence at School'in intervention schools (intervention group 1). Individuals in intervention group 2 received this active transport lesson and, in addition, they were asked to become a member of a Facebook group on active transport. Individuals in the control group only attended the regular course `Driving Licence at School'. Participants completed a questionnaire assessing socio-demographics and psychosocial variables at baseline, post (after one week) and follow-up (after eight weeks). To assess intervention effects, multilevel linear mixed models analyses were performed. Results A sample of 441 older adolescents (56.8{\%} female; 17.4 (0.7) years) was analysed. For awareness regarding the existence of car sharing schemes, a significant increase in awareness from baseline to post measurement was found within intervention group 1 (p = 0.001) and intervention group 2 (p = 0.030) compared to the control group in which no change was found. In addition, a significant increase in awareness from baseline to follow-up measurement was found within intervention group 1 (p = 0.043) compared to a decrease in awareness from baseline to follow-up measurement within the control group. Conclusions Overall, the intervention was not effective to increase psychosocial correlates of active transport. Future intervention studies should search for alternative strategies to motivate and involve this hard to reach target group.},

	n2 = {Policies aiming to increase the sustainability in urban transport often face the problem of overcoming unsustainable behavior patterns that are principally centered on the car and largely dominated by routinebased mode choices. Social psychology offers a series of persuasion techniques that are able to strengthen the impact of community based Travel Behavior Change programs such as the voluntary TravelSmart programs recently conducted in some of Melbourne's inner suburbs. This paper presents results of an experiment that has applied six particular persuasion techniques as part of a community-based TravelSmart campaign. In a pilot test of 160 households, combinations of persuasion elements were tested in eight different treatment groups while controlling for a number of socio-demographic variables. Although not statistically significant at a 95{\%} confidence level because of limited sample size, the results indicate an increase in participation when persuasion strategies were integrated into the TravelSmart recruitment process. Modelling the intervention up-take as a function of socio-demographic variables indicates the problem of linguistic barriers associated with a multi-cultural urban population. In contrast, bicycle availability and current use of public transit both have a positive impact on TravelSmart participation. Overall, the results indicate the need to explore an extension of the persuasion principles from their use in the recruitment process to at all other implementation stages of voluntary Travel Behaviour Change programs.},

@article{affolderbachMobileTransitionsExploring2016,
	abstract = {Urban sustainability approaches focusing on a wide range of topics such as infrastructure and mobility, green construction and neighbourhood planning, or urban nature and green amenities have attracted scholarly interest for over three decades. Recent debates on the role of cities in climate change mitigation have triggered new attempts to conceptually and methodologically grasp the cross-sectorial and cross-level interplay of enrolled actors. Within these debates, urban and economic geographers have increasingly adopted co-evolutionary approaches such as the social studies of technology (SST or `transition studies'). Their plea for more spatial sensitivity of the transition approach has led to promising proposals to adapt geographic perspectives to case studies on urban sustainability. This paper advocates engagement with recent work in urban studies, specifically policy mobility, to explore conceptual and methodological synergies. It emphasises four strengths of an integrated approach: (1) a broadened understanding of innovations that emphasises not only processes of knowledge generation but also of knowledge transfer through (2) processes of learning, adaptation and mutation, (3) a relational understanding of the origin and dissemination of innovations focused on the complex nature of cities and (4) the importance of individual actors as agents of change and analytical scale that highlights social processes of innovation. The notion of urban assemblages further allows the operationalisation of both the relational embeddedness of local policies as well as their cross-sectoral actor constellations.},

It suggests that the existing paradigm ought to be more flexible, particularly if the sustainable mobility agenda is to become a reality. The second part argues that policy measures are available to improve urban sustainability in transport terms but that the main challenges relate to the necessary conditions for change. These conditions are dependent upon high-quality implementation of innovative schemes, and the need to gain public confidence and acceptability to support these measures through active involvement and action. Seven key elements of sustainable mobility are outlined, so that public acceptability can be more effectively promoted.},

	abstract = {The transdisciplinary research mode has gained prominence in the research on and for sustainability transformations. Yet, solution-oriented research addressing complex sustainability problems has become complex itself, with new transdisciplinary research formats being developed and tested for this purpose. Application of new formats offers learning potentials from experience. To this end, we accompanied fourteen research projects conceptualized as real-world labs (RwLs) from 2015 to 2018. RwLs were part of a funding program on `Science for Sustainability' in the German federal state of Baden-W{\"u}rttemberg. Here, we combine conceptual and empirical work to a structured collection of experiences and provide a comprehensive account of RwLs. First, we outline characteristics of RwLs as transformation oriented, transdisciplinary research approach, using experiments, enabling learning and having a long-term orientation. Second, we outline eleven success factors and concrete design notes we gained through a survey of the 14 RwLs: (1) find the right balance between scientific and societal aims, (2) address the practitioners needs and restrictions, (3) make use of the experimentation concept, (4) actively communicate, (5) develop a `collaboration culture', (6) be attached to concrete sites, (7) create lasting impact and transferability, (8) plan for sufficient time and financial means, (9) adaptability, (10) research-based learning, and (11) recognize dependency on external actors. Characteristics and success factors are combined to illustrate practical challenges in RwLs. Third, we show which methods could be used to cope with challenges in RwLs. We conclude discussing the state of debate on RwLs and outline future avenues of research.},

@article{bulkeleyGovernmentExperimentGlobal2013,
	abstract = {In this paper, we argue for an approach that goes beyond an institutional reading of urban climate governance to engage with the ways in which government is accomplished through social and technical practices. Central to the exercise of government in this manner, we argue, are `climate change experiments'-- purposive interventions in urban socio-technical systems designed to respond to the imperatives of mitigating and adapting to climate change in the city. Drawing on three different concepts -- of governance experiments, socio-technical experiments, and strategic experiments -- we first develop a framework for understanding the nature and dynamics of urban climate change experiments. We use this conceptual analysis to frame a scoping study of the global dimensions of urban climate change experimentation in a database of 627 urban climate change experiments in 100 global cities. The analysis charts when and where these experiments occur, the relationship between the social and technical aspects of experimentation and the governance of urban climate change experimentation, including the actors involved in their governing and the extent to which new political spaces for experimentation are emerging in the contemporary city. We find that experiments serve to create new forms of political space within the city, as public and private authority blur, and are primarily enacted through forms of technical intervention in infrastructure networks, drawing attention to the importance of such sites in urban climate politics. These findings point to an emerging research agenda on urban climate change experiments that needs to engage with the diversity of experimentation in different urban contexts, how they are conducted in practice and their impacts and implications for urban governance and urban life.},

@article{coenenSpatialPerspectiveSustainability2012,
	abstract = {In the past decade, the literature on transitions toward sustainable socio-technical systems has made a considerable contribution in understanding the complex and multi-dimensional shifts considered necessary to adapt societies and economies to sustainable modes of production and consumption. However, transition analyses have often neglected where transitions take place, and the spatial configurations and dynamics of the networks within which transitions evolve. A more explicit spatial perspective on sustainability transitions contributes to the extant transitions literature in three ways. Firstly it provides a contextualization on the limited territorial sensitivity of existing literature. Secondly, it explicitly acknowledges and investigates diversity in transition processes, which follows from a `natural' variety in institutional conditions, networks, actor strategies and resources across space. Thirdly, it encompasses not only greater emphasis but also an opportunity to connect to a body of literature geared to understanding the international, trans-local nature of transition dynamics. Concerned with the prevalent lack of attention for the spatial dimensions of sustainability transitions in most studies, this paper seeks to unpick and make explicit sustainability transition geographies from the vantage point of economic geography. The paper argues that there are two interrelated problems requiring attention: the institutional embeddedness of socio-technical development processes within specific territorial spaces, and an explicit multi-scalar conception of socio-technical trajectories. Following these arguments, the paper concludes that transitions research would do well to take a closer look at the geographical unevenness of transition processes from the perspective of global networks and local nodes.},

@article{fazeyTenEssentialsActionoriented2018,
	abstract = {The most critical question for climate research is no longer about the problem, but about how to facilitate the transformative changes necessary to avoid catastrophic climate-induced change. Addressing this question, however, will require massive upscaling of research that can rapidly enhance learning about transformations. Ten essentials for guiding action-oriented transformation and energy research are therefore presented, framed in relation to second-order science. They include: (1) Focus on transformations to low-carbon, resilient living; (2) Focus on solution processes; (3) Focus on `how to' practical knowledge; (4) Approach research as occurring from within the system being intervened; (5) Work with normative aspects; (6) Seek to transcend current thinking; (7) Take a multi-faceted approach to understand and shape change; (8) Acknowledge the value of alternative roles of researchers; (9) Encourage second-order experimentation; and (10) Be reflexive. Joint application of the essentials would create highly adaptive, reflexive, collaborative and impact-oriented research able to enhance capacity to respond to the climate challenge. At present, however, the practice of such approaches is limited and constrained by dominance of other approaches. For wider transformations to low carbon living and energy systems to occur, transformations will therefore also be needed in the way in which knowledge is produced and used.},

@article{geelsTechnologicalTransitionsEvolutionary2002,
	abstract = {This paper addresses the question of how technological transitions (TT) come about? Are there particular patterns and mechanisms in transition processes? TT are defined as major, long-term technological changes in the way societal functions are fulfilled. TT do not only involve changes in technology, but also changes in user practices, regulation, industrial networks, infrastructure, and symbolic meaning or culture. This paper practices `appreciative theory' [R.R. Nelson, S.G. Winter, An Evolutionary Theory of Economic Change, Bellknap Press, Cambridge, MA, 1982] and brings together insights from evolutionary economics and technology studies. This results in a multi-level perspective on TT where two views of the evolution are combined: (i) evolution as a process of variation, selection and retention, (ii) evolution as a process of unfolding and reconfiguration. The perspective is empirically illustrated with a qualitative longitudinal case-study, the transition from sailing ships to steamships, 1780--1900. Three particular mechanisms in TT are described: niche-cumulation, technological add-on and hybridisation, riding along with market growth.},

@article{givoniAddressingTransportPolicy2014,
	abstract = {Policy packaging is not a new concept and hardly anyone would dispute the merit of strategically considering and deploying several policy measures in combination to address transport policy issues. Yet the concept of policy packaging remains largely vague, and how to `package' policies is not really considered or suggested. Policy packaging in most cases remains just a term. The Optimal Policies for Transport in Combination (OPTIC) project aimed to start advancing state-of-the-art in the design of policy packages. The project objective was to turn policy packaging into a well-established approach to policy making, with solid theoretical and methodological foundations that can also be practically applied in the field. This editorial to the special issue on Policy Packaging serves to first define and explain the main principles of policy packaging and the goals it strives to achieve: increasing effectiveness, implementability and thus efficiency. It then describes the main contribution of each of the papers in the special issue to research and practice of policy packaging and it outlines some avenues for further research. The paper concludes by setting a few criteria to distinguish a policy package from a `list' of policies and by arguing that only through case studies and application in practice that state-of-the-art policy packaging can be really advanced.},

We identify five main distinguishing TIP characteristics and analyse the literature's understanding of how they influence the policymaking process. The analysis shows that the literature discusses TIP-related challenges in all stages of the policy cycle but does not provide much guidance on how to address key cross-cutting policymaking challenges such as how to achieve broad stakeholder involvement, evaluate transformative outcomes, and build up dynamic policymaker capabilities. In order for TIP ideas to be implemented in real-life policymaking, TIP scholars, therefore, need to more explicitly consider the practitioners' perspective and develop concrete models, tools and guidelines that help policymakers address the identified challenges.},

Specifically, we advocate a stance toward the application of qualitative methods that legitimizes insights from the situated life-with-others of the researcher.

@book{hoffmannClimateGovernanceCrossroads2011,
	abstract = {The global response to climate change has reached a critical juncture. Since the 1992 signing of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the nations of the world have attempted to address climate change through large-scale multilateral treaty-making. These efforts have been heroic, but disappointing. As evidence for the quickening pace of climate change mounts, the treaty-making process has sputtered, and many are now skeptical about the prospect of an effective global response. Yet global treaty-making is not the only way that climate change can be addressed or, indeed, is being addressed. In the last decade myriad initiatives have emerged across the globe independently from, or only loosely connected to, the "official" UN-sponsored negotiations and treaties. In the face of stalemate in the formal negotiations, the world is experimenting with alternate means of responding to climate change. Climate Governance at the Crossroads chronicles these innovations--how cities, provinces and states, citizen groups, and corporations around the globe are addressing the causes and symptoms of global warming. The center of gravity in the global response to climate change is shifting from the multilateral treaty-making process to the diverse activities found beyond the negotiating halls. These innovations are pushing the envelope of climate action and demonstrating what is possible, and they provide hope that the world will respond effectively to the climate crisis. In introducing climate governance "experiments" and examining the development and functioning of this new world of climate policy-making, this book provides an exciting new perspective on the politics of climate change and the means to understand and influence how the global response to climate change will unfold in the coming years.},

@article{joostMobilityTransitionLabs2025,
	abstract = {Major transformations are needed to achieve more sustainable transport practices. Taking the persistence of transport systems into account, a variety of participatory and experimental approaches have emerged, such as urban living labs and real-world labs, to develop solutions in a transdisciplinary collaboration. Despite the anticipated importance of such transdisciplinary approaches, there remains a gap in the empirical evaluation of their effectiveness in driving sustainable change. To better understand the potential of such approaches, we used a scoping review of existing literature on (1) the extent to which transdisciplinary lab approaches are used in transportation, (2) how they are conducted in terms of transdisciplinary collaboration and (3) how outcomes are measured and evaluated. The results show that transdisciplinary labs are still generally a marginal but growing approach in the field of transportation. They cover a wide range from technology-centred to socio-ecological approaches with varying levels of stakeholder involvement. We highlight the potential of transdisciplinary labs to bridge long-standing participation gaps within transportation planning. Yet, robust evaluation of results within these approaches is limited. This constrains the empirical significance of the results and hinders transferability and scalability.},

@article{kohlerWhoWeMobilise2024,
	abstract = {In this paper we reflect on insights concerning participation in and effects of a real-world laboratory designed to disrupt car dependency in everyday practices in an urban setting. After outlining the project and key findings, we critically reflect on design and achievements of this real-world laboratory more generally. In particular, we discuss the following questions: Who is it that we can address through transformative mobilities research in real-world laboratories? Who are the participants and what are their motives for taking part in the research? To contextualize the research findings within a real-world setting and research paradigm we extend the scope to a second set of questions: How can we conceptualise the relationship between participants and researchers and how do we account for opposing rationalities of interruption (research) and maintenance (participants) of the organisation of everyday life? How does this research enable transformative mobilities? And, finally, what can we say about the scope of our findings and reflections? In the thicket of doing transformative research encouraging and accompanying volunteers to become active in transformative mobility research becomes questions of language, educational background and time resources from the involved, but also being aware of institutionalized change actor networks, unchallenged hierarchies of superior ``academic'' research and being part of political struggles that require to look closely within and outside of the actual real-world-experiment especially in times of multiple crises.

We discuss the results of an explorative study of the use of a personal mobility tracker (a digital, data-based tool) to motivate users to adopt a more sustainable city lifestyle. We examine motivational techniques that can influence citizens' personal mobility on a day-to-day basis. Using a personal mobility app that incorporates gamified elements and nudging, citizens become part of a community. They are motivated to cycle more and to explore sustainable services in the city through tours and visiting points of interest. We present the first results of a trial of this mobile app: characteristics of users, and empirical data that indicate a change in cycling behaviour. We also show effects of nudging on personal mobility.},

@article{marsdenQuestionsGovernanceRethinking2017,
	abstract = {This paper critiques the state of the art approaches to studying transportation policy. It does so through analysing 100 papers sampled from the two leading policy journals in the transportation literature. On applying two different frameworks for understanding policy, the review finds that only 13\% of papers consider specific aspects of the policy cycle, that 60\% focus on `tools' for policy, and that two-thirds of papers did not engage with real-world policy examples or policy makers and focussed on quantitative analysis alone. We argue that these findings highlight the persistence of the technical-rational model within the transportation literature. This model, and the numerous traditions and disciplines that have fed into it have an important role to play in developing the transportation evidence base. However, we argue there are important questions of governance; such as context, power, resources and legitimacy, that are largely being ignored in the literature as it stands. The substantial lack of engagement with governance issues and debates means that as a field we are artificially, but more importantly, disproportionately generating a science of applied policy making which is unlikely to be utilised because of the distance between it and the realities on the ground. The paper identifies analytical approaches deployed readily in other fields that could be used to address some of the key deficiencies.},

@article{parliDesigningInterventionsSustainable2022,
	abstract = {Real-world laboratories (RWL) aim to support transformations for sustainable urban development by producing outputs with practical and scientific relevance. To achieve these aims, the local community of which the RWL is a part should be in close collaboration from the start of a project. RWLs offer spaces for `thinking outside the box' and for experimenting with new ideas through concrete interventions into the life world of the community. We provide methodological guidance for researchers on how to design interventions in RWLs that both affect change on the ground and contribute to scientific knowledge. This includes addressing issues important to local communities and generating transformation knowledge about how sustainable urban development can be actualised. We use the case of a project-based master's course within an RWL in the city of Zurich in Switzerland to demonstrate how the use of design thinking supported the development of needs-based interventions, curbing emissions from food consumption while aiming to generate scientifically relevant output. We conclude that further improvements in methodology are needed in order to test the effectiveness of interventions. However, the outputs of the approach show its potential both for having an impact in the real world and building on existing academic concepts for advancing transformation knowledge.},

Using examples drawn mainly from the field of mental health, it will be argued in this paper that the application of generalizable, research-based knowledge to individual, unique, person-centred practice, the so-called 'research-based practice' advocated by the Department of Health, is one of the main causes of the theory-practice gap. It will be further suggested that nursing requires a paradigm of clinical research which focuses on the individual therapeutic encounter in order to complement the existing sociological paradigm of theoretical research which is best suited to the generation of generalizable knowledge and theory. The paper will conclude by suggesting that such a clinically based research paradigm must not only focus on the individual nurse-patient relationship, but that it must be carried out by the nurse herself. Clinical research, if it is to make a difference to practice, must therefore be practitioner-based research.},

@article{saviniUrbanExperimentationPolitics2019,
	abstract = {Experimentation has become an increasingly dominant and celebrated practice in urban governance. Used by planners and policy-makers seeking to manage and organize a positive transition to a ?better? world, experiments are generally seen as desirable and even necessary to achieve this goal. The quintessentially political nature of this approach to urban change, however, remains insufficiently addressed in planning and policy literature. This paper argues that experimental agency entails a set of political biases and normative assumptions that deserve to be problematized. Critically building on the analytical insights of evolutionary theory, we develop a critique of experimental action, arguing that experiments express a ?politics of niches? which occur across three processes: the creation, selection and retention of emergent practices within established institutional orders. Using empirical evidence from contemporary practices in Amsterdam, we sketch four trajectories of niches: death, marginalization, assimilation and transformation. We conclude by reflecting on the political implications of experimentation for urban theory and practice.},

@article{schotThreeFramesInnovation2018,
	abstract = {Science, technology and innovation (STI) policy is shaped by persistent framings that arise from historical context. Two established frames are identified as co-existing and dominant in contemporary innovation policy discussions. The first frame is identified as beginning with a Post-World War II institutionalisation of government support for science and R\&D with the presumption that this would contribute to growth and address market failure in private provision of new knowledge. The second frame emerged in the 1980s globalising world and its emphasis on competitiveness which is shaped by the national systems of innovation for knowledge creation and commercialisation. STI policy focuses on building links, clusters and networks, and on stimulating learning between elements in the systems, and enabling entrepreneurship. A third frame linked to contemporary social and environmental challenges such as the Sustainable Development Goals and calling for transformative change is identified and distinguished from the two earlier frames. Transformation refers to socio-technical system change as conceptualised in the sustainability transitions literature. The nature of this third framing is examined with the aim of identifying its key features and its potential for provoking a re-examination of the earlier two frames. One key feature is its focus on experimentation, and the argument that the Global South does not need to play catch-up to follow the transformation model of the Global North. It is argued that all three frames are relevant for policymaking, but exploring options for transformative innovation policy should be a priority.},

@article{simonofskiSmartMobilityProjects2023,
	abstract = {Smart mobility, one of the key smart city application areas, has been increasingly important in the daily management of cities. Smart mobility can improve citizens' well-being and reach sustainability objectives by establishing an appropriate mobility system. However, despite the availability of research about practical smart mobility cases, the required smart mobility building blocks, and the technical requirements of smart mobility systems, a formal policy-making lifecycle to guide the execution of smart mobility projects is missing. The goal of this paper is to distill a policy-making lifecycle of smart mobility projects by investigating how these are commonly executed. To reach this goal, sixteen interviews with stakeholders from diverse Belgian and Dutch cities are conducted and eight documents related to smart mobility are analyzed. These data sources allowed to design and validate a holistic smart mobility framework. The framework includes seven phases (idea, analysis, agenda-setting, preparation, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation) and links each phase with the stakeholders involved (public agents, citizen, companies, and researchers) and related challenges. The key challenging aspect in the execution of smart mobility projects relates to the need for balancing many factors such as capacity or procedures. This paper is relevant to local governments of medium and large cities to help them approach smart mobility projects in a more holistic manner. Furthermore, this paper is relevant for researchers as it provides an analytical lens to examine smart mobility projects in smart cities.},

@article{vitkauskaite-ramanauskieneApplicationActionResearch,
	abstract = {The rising prevalence of passenger vehicles is inextricably linked to the mounting environmental challenges we face. The decision to engage in unsustainable mobility behaviours is influenced not only by external circumstances but also by internal factors. It is therefore essential to create not only external conditions conducive to sustainable mobility but also incentives that activate internal factors if the goals of sustainable mobility are to be achieved. A growing body of literature posits that novel solutions should be developed in a co-creative manner with the very individuals for whom they are intended. The methodology of action research, which is performed in cyclical process in collaboration between researcher and research participants, is particularly conducive to this objective. This methodological approach was employed in an intervention study, during which the sustainable mobility initiative `Move Green' was created, implemented and evaluated. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with initiative participants, who provided suggestions regarding the development and implementation of the intervention at a higher level. Following the combination of the intervention model used in the study with the participants' suggestions, the article presents a specific proposal for a soft sustainable mobility promotion measure: a gamified sustainable mobility application for work teams.},

@article{vonwirthImpactsUrbanLiving2019,
	abstract = {Urban Living Labs (ULL) are considered spaces to facilitate experimentation about sustainability solutions. ULL represent sites that allow different urban actors to design, test and learn from socio-technical innovations. However, despite their recent proliferation in the European policy sphere, the underlying processes through which ULL might be able to generate and diffuse new socio-technical configurations beyond their immediate boundaries have been largely disregarded and it remains to be examined how they contribute to urban sustainability transitions. With this study, we contribute to a better understanding of the diffusion mechanisms and strategies through which ULL (seek to) create a wider impact using the conceptual lens of transition studies. The mechanisms of diffusion are investigated in four distinct ULL in Rotterdam, the Netherlands and Malm{\"o}, Sweden. The empirical results indicate six specific strategies that aim to support the diffusion of innovations and know-how developed within ULL to a broader context: transformative place-making, activating network partners, replication of lab structure, education and training, stimulating entrepreneurial growth and narratives of impact.},

@article{williamsCanLowCarbon2016,
	abstract = {The paper explores the ability of urban transition experiments to transform the development regime in which they are embedded. Using three European case studies - BedZed, Vauban and Hammarby - it investigates the processes of broadening and scaling-up within cities, nations and across cities globally; and finds that transition experiments do influence the development regime in which they are embedded. The impact of experiments on the development regime does vary significantly with scale. The innovative components, which are assembled in experiments (cultural, structural and practices) also seem to have differing propensity to influence the development regime at different scales. Thus, cultural innovations have a greater propensity to influence the development regime across all scales, whilst the structural and practice innovations tend to influence the development regime locally and nationally. The case studies also demonstrated the significance of context (historical and geographical) in shaping experiments and influencing the transformation process. This finding suggests that the importance of broadening in the transformation process has been overstated. The experiments show that broadening across national boundaries and for prolonged periods, can result in expanding niche-regimes which become increasingly diverse. But it does not result in transformation. {\copyright} 2016 The Authors.},

@article{williamsLostTranslationTranslating2017,
	abstract = {Low carbon urban transition experiments are emerging across cities globally. These experiments are socio-technical innovations with a high potential to contribute to a low carbon. Through the Global Intelligence Corps knowledge of these experiments is being disseminated across a variety of spatial contexts. Foreign cities are keen to replicate these examples of best practice; whilst technical experts, technology providers and governments are keen to export their expertise and technologies. However, the factors influencing the successful translation - movement, transformation and adaptation - of these experiments across spatial contexts requires deeper investigation. This paper explores the process using a mobile transitions conceptualisation. In this paper we develop a theoretical conceptualisation of the mobile transition process and test it using two low carbon experiments - Hammarby Sjostad (Stockholm) and BedZed (London). We identify the type of knowledge that is translatable (in the global form), and how this is modified both by the global and local assemblages throughout the process. The implication of our findings is that greater clarity is needed throughout the translation process if outcomes are to improve. Firstly, in order to determine the potential for an urban experiment to translate into a new spatial context the practitioner must understand the context from which it emerged and the context into which it will be translated. Secondly practitioners need to clearly define the translatable global form emerging from an experiment. It must be possible to decontextualise and re-contextualise the global form if it is to translate successfully. In some cases it may be impossible to decontextualise the global form without undermining the fundamental principles underlying the experiment. Thirdly, practitioners need to be aware of how the global form can be manipulated and re-represented by the global and local assemblages during the translation process. The global form is not fixed. Finally practitioners should be aware that new socio-technical systems (adopting the fundamental principles developed in the experiment) will emerge from the translation process.},

@article{zhaoTemporaryMeasuresHow2025,
	abstract = {Tactical urbanism aims to rapidly transform urban environments through iterative experimentation. However, we know little about how learning shapes the long-term effectiveness and transformative potential of these interventions. This paper examines the role of local government implementers' learning in sustaining tactical urbanism practices, specifically through the lens of street experiments implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using experiential learning theory as a conceptual framework, we conducted and analysed interviews with 40 government representatives associated with 28 street experiments across 21 cities globally. Our analysis reveals three distinct learning processes among the implementers, arranged progressively: (1) implement and execute, (2) experiment and perpetuate, and (3) experiment and conceptualise. While implementers engaging primarily in the first two processes demonstrated responsiveness by leveraging tactical urbanism during systemic disruptions, they rarely generated transferable knowledge or sustained transformative impacts. By contrast, implementers who adopted the third approach -- experiment and conceptualise -- actively reflected on and generalised their experiences, leading to deeper learning and structural changes. These implementers effectively harnessed street experiments as catalysts for broader urban mobility transitions. By providing empirical evidence from diverse global contexts, this study advances our understanding of how learning processes influence the development of tactical urbanism projects. These insights could assist urban practitioners in seeking to embed meaningful, lasting change in urban mobility through iterative experimentation.},

In their Discussion Paper Schot and Steinmueller (2018) argue that the existing theorizing and knowledge bases within the field of innovation studies are ``unfit'' for this task and that a totally new approach is required. This paper takes issue with this claim. Policy advice, it is argued, needs to be anchored in the accumulated research on the issue at hand, in this case, innovation. The paper therefore starts by distilling some important insights on innovation from the accumulated research on this topic and, with this in mind, considers various policy approaches that have been suggested for influencing innovation and sustainability transitions. Finally, the lessons for the development and implementation of transformative innovation policy are considered. It is concluded that the existing theorizing and knowledge base in innovation studies may be of great relevance when designing policies for dealing with climate change and sustainability transitions.},

@article{Sovacool:2020aa,
	abstract = {Much academic research on low-carbon transitions focuses on the diffusion or use of innovations such as electric vehicles or solar panels, but overlooks or obscures downstream and upstream processes, such as mining or waste flows. Yet it is at these two extremes where emerging low-carbon transitions in mobility and electricity are effectively implicated in toxic pollution, biodiversity loss, exacerbation of gender inequality, exploitation of child labor, and the subjugation of ethnic minorities. We conceptualize these processes as part of an emerging ``decarbonisation divide.''To illustrate this divide with clear insights for political ecology, sustainability transitions, and energy justice research, this study draws from extensive fieldwork examining cobalt mining in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), and the processing and recycling of electronic waste in Ghana. It utilizes original data from 34 semi-structured research interviews with experts and 69 community interviews with artisanal cobalt miners, e-waste scrapyard workers, and other stakeholders, as well as 50 site visits. These visits included 30 industrial and artisanal cobalt mines in the DRC, as well as associated infrastructure such as trading depots and processing centers, and 20 visits to the Agbogbloshie scrapyard and neighborhood alongside local waste collection sites, electrical repair shops, recycling centers, and community e-waste dumps in Ghana. The study proposes a concerted set of policy recommendations for how to better address issues of exploitation and toxicity, suggestions that go beyond the often-touted solutions of formalisation or financing. Ultimately, the study holds that we must all, as researchers, planners, and citizens, broaden the criteria and analytical parameters we use to evaluate the sustainability of low-carbon transitions.},

The paper also studies in detail the determinants of attitudes in terms of political and socio-demographic variables. Among many results, we find limited knowledge but high concern for climate change. We also document a large rejection of the carbon tax but majority support for stricter norms and green investments, and reveal the rationales behind these preferences. Our study entails policy recommendations, such as an information campaign on climate change. Indeed, we find that climate awareness increases support for climate policies but no evidence for the formation of opinions through partisan cues as in the US, suggesting that better access to science could foster support for climate policies.},

We set up a discrete collective (cooperative) model in which spouses with competing objectives reach a Pareto optimal decision, and we apply it to Paris region. We estimate the determinants of the bargaining power (spouses'age, nationality, type of job contract, tenure status and number of children) using this collective model. To control for the endogeneity of car ownership, we finally model the joint choice of car ownership and mode. Econometric estimations show that spouses'values of time driving alone and together are significantly different.},

	abstract = {In this paper we examine empirically the market for local amenities in the Paris metropolitan region. We find first that there is considerable inequality in the spatial distribution of these local amenities, including accessibility, environmental and social indicators. We use a spatial representation and Lorenz curves to examine the degree of inequality in these amenities, and this provides evidence that some amenities (or disamenities) are much more inequitably distributed than others. The most extremely unequally distributed amenities are noise (due to its concentration near airports), ``Redevelopment Areas'', presence of water (lakes and rivers) and forests, and presence of train and subway stations. Some indicators, such as the ``Poulit accessibility'' measure, were by contrast remarkably constant over the region. We recognize that local amenities should be capitalized into the housing market, and explore the willingness to pay of households for these amenities within the Paris region using alternative specifications of a location choice model. One of the core questions we examine is the spatial scale of the amenity effects and how this is captured in a location choice context. By estimating models at both a commune and at a grid cell level, we obtain new insights into how households in the Paris region trade off amenities against each other and against housing cost. We find that the residential location choice model fits the data moderately better at the smaller scale of the grid cell compared to the commune.},

	abstract = {Month of birth influences adult life expectancy at ages 50+. Why? In two countries of the Northern Hemisphere?Austria and Denmark?people born in autumn (October?December) live longer than those born in spring (April?June). Data for Australia show that, in the Southern Hemisphere, the pattern is shifted by half a year. The lifespan pattern of British immigrants to Australia is similar to that of Austrians and Danes and significantly different from that of Australians. These findings are based on population data with more than a million observations and little or no selectivity. The differences in lifespan are independent of the seasonal distribution of deaths and the social differences in the seasonal distribution of births. In the Northern Hemisphere, the excess mortality in the first year of life of infants born in spring does not support the explanation of selective infant survival. Instead, remaining life expectancy at age 50 appears to depend on factors that arise in utero or early in infancy and that increase susceptibility to diseases later in life. This result is consistent with the finding that, at the turn of the last century, infants born in autumn had higher birth weights than those born in other seasons. Furthermore, differences in adult lifespan by month of birth decrease over time and are significantly smaller in more recent cohorts, which benefited from substantial improvements in maternal and infant health.},

	abstract = {A simulation evaluation is presented to compare alternative estimation techniques for a five-alternative multinomial probit (MNP) model with random parameters, including cross-sectional and panel datasets and for scenarios with and without correlation among random parameters. The different estimation techniques assessed are: (1) The maximum approximate composite marginal likelihood (MACML) approach; (2) The Geweke-Hajivassiliou-Keane (GHK) simulator with Halton sequences, implemented in conjunction with the composite marginal likelihood (CML) estimation approach; (3) The GHK approach with sparse grid nodes and weights, implemented in conjunction with the composite marginal likelihood (CML) estimation approach; and (4) a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach. In addition, for comparison purposes, the GHK simulator with Halton sequences was implemented in conjunction with the traditional, full information maximum likelihood approach as well. The results indicate that the MACML approach provided the best performance in terms of the accuracy and precision of parameter recovery and estimation time for all data generation settings considered in this study. For panel data settings, the GHK approach with Halton sequences, when combined with the CML approach, provided better performance than when implemented with the full information maximum likelihood approach, albeit not better than the MACML approach. The sparse grid approach did not perform well in recovering the parameters as the dimension of integration increased, particularly so with the panel datasets. The Bayesian MCMC approach performed well in datasets without correlations among random parameters, but exhibited limitations in datasets with correlated parameters.},

In this work, we propose an event-driven framework that anticipates unknown changes arising in the context of dynamic vehicle routing. The framework is intrinsically parallelized to take advantage of modern multi-core and multi-threaded computing architectures. It is also designed to be easily embeddable in decision support systems that cope with a wide range of contexts and side constraints. We illustrate the flexibility of the framework by showing how it can be adapted to tackle the dynamic vehicle routing problem with stochastic demands.},

	abstract = {Projections of countries? future populations, broken down by age and sex, are widely used for planning and research. They are mostly done deterministically, but there is a widespread need for probabilistic projections. We propose a Bayesian method for probabilistic population projections for all countries. The total fertility rate and female and male life expectancies at birth are projected probabilistically using Bayesian hierarchical models estimated via Markov chain Monte Carlo using United Nations population data for all countries. These are then converted to age-specific rates and combined with a cohort component projection model. This yields probabilistic projections of any population quantity of interest. The method is illustrated for five countries of different demographic stages, continents and sizes. The method is validated by an out of sample experiment in which data from 1950?1990 are used for estimation, and applied to predict 1990?2010. The method appears reasonably accurate and well calibrated for this period. The results suggest that the current United Nations high and low variants greatly underestimate uncertainty about the number of oldest old from about 2050 and that they underestimate uncertainty for high fertility countries and overstate uncertainty for countries that have completed the demographic transition and whose fertility has started to recover towards replacement level, mostly in Europe. The results also indicate that the potential support ratio (persons aged 20?64 per person aged 65+) will almost certainly decline dramatically in most countries over the coming decades.},

@article{Sun:2015aa,
	abstract = {Agent-based micro-simulation models require a complete list of agents with detailed demographic/socioeconomic information for the purpose of behavior modeling and simulation. This paper introduces a new alternative for population synthesis based on Bayesian networks. A Bayesian network is a graphical representation of a joint probability distribution, encoding probabilistic relationships among a set of variables in an efficient way. Similar to the previously developed probabilistic approach, in this paper, we consider the population synthesis problem to be the inference of a joint probability distribution. In this sense, the Bayesian network model becomes an efficient tool that allows us to compactly represent/reproduce the structure of the population system and preserve privacy and confidentiality in the meanwhile. We demonstrate and assess the performance of this approach in generating synthetic population for Singapore, by using the Household Interview Travel Survey (HITS) data as the known test population. Our results show that the introduced Bayesian network approach is powerful in characterizing the underlying joint distribution, and meanwhile the overfitting of data can be avoided as much as possible.},

@article{Joubert:2020aa,
	abstract = {While activity-based travel demand generation has improved over the last few decades, the behavioural richness and intuitive interpretation remain challenging. This paper argues that it is essential to understand why people travel the way they do and not only be able to predict the overall activity patterns accurately. If one cannot understand the ``why?''then a model's ability to evaluate the impact of future interventions is severely diminished. Bayesian networks (BNs) provide the ability to investigate causality and is showing value in recent literature to generate synthetic populations. This paper is novel in extending the application of BNs to daily activity tours. Results show that BNs can synthesise both activity and trip chain structures accurately. It outperforms a frequentist approach and can cater for infrequently observed activity patterns, and patterns unobserved in small sample data. It can also account for temporal variables like activity duration.},

We take random subsamples of varying sizes of stated preference data regarding ultra-low emission vehicle purchases in California and focus on the willingness-to-pay for improvements in driving range. Prior information is obtained from a meta-analysis of consumer valuation of driving range. We find the posterior distribution of the willingness-to-pay using a tight and a weakly informative prior, and also analyze the nonparametric estimates of the posterior compare these with the likelihood function of the problem. It is found that the weight of the prior is relevant for very small samples, but for standard sample sizes the prior vanishes. Thus, the Bayes estimator of a static discrete choice model is in general equivalent to the maximum likelihood estimator, although for some intermediate sample sizes the prior provides more realistic values.},

	abstract = {An exciting development in modeling has been the ability to estimate reliable individual-level parameters for choice models. Individual partworths derived from these parameters have been very useful in segmentation, identifying extreme individuals, and in creating appropriate choice simulators. In marketing, hierarchical Bayes models have taken the lead in combining information about the aggregate distribution of tastes with the individual's choices to arrive at a conditional estimate of the individual's parameters. In economics, the same behavioral model has been derived from a classical rather than a Bayesian perspective. That is, instead of Gibbs sampling, the method of maximum simulated likelihood provides estimates of both the aggregate and the individual parameters. This paper explores the similarities and differences between classical and Bayesian methods and shows that they result in virtually equivalent conditional estimates of partworths for customers. Thus, the choice between Bayesian and classical estimation becomes one of implementation convenience and philosophical orientation, rather than pragmatic usefulness.},

	abstract = {Synthetic spatial microdata enable analyses of artificial populations in the form of individual unit record files at a small area level. They allow analyses of estimates of variables that are otherwise not available at this small area level, while preserving the confidentiality of personal data. This type of data has mainly been used to provide more detailed census data and for spatial microsimulation modelling: for example to analyse social policy and population changes, transportation, marketing strategies or health outcomes. We argue that many potential applications for synthetic spatial microdata remain to be developed. One reason for this is the lack of information about and confidence in this type of data. Introductory literature about creating synthetic spatial microdata and discussions on the decisions that need to be taken during the data generation process are rare. In this paper, we therefore review currently existing methods to generate synthetic spatial microdata in a manner which will support most readers who are considering this approach, and we address the main issues of the data generation process with regards to analyses of neighbourhood level data. We discuss further possible applications of these data and the importance of synthetic spatial microdata.},

	abstract = {With the rise of smart cities, a number of new mobility services have emerged to drive changes in built environment policies. Up-to-date demand models are needed to capture the impact of these policies on emerging mobility-enabled travel patterns. The study explores modeling requirements to assess the impact of such built environment policies. A synthetic population of New York City with a tour-based nested logit mode choice model was developed with accessibility to bikesharing and ride hail services via smartphone ownership. The model results suggest Manhattanites have a value of time of {\$}29/h, consistent with the literature. Smartphone ownership is positively influenced by income and negatively influenced by age, and in turn negatively impacts Citi Bike ridership relative to other modes available. The synthetic population is also applied to analyze two city-scale built environment scenarios: a hypothetical Amazon headquarter deployment and a Citi Bike service expansion. If Amazon succeeded in Long Island City, it would have increased the number of trips to/from that neighborhood by 239{\%}, of which FHVs would grow by over 441{\%} and transit by 294{\%}. It would have led to an increase of peak morning trips from 5000 up to at least 8000. Citi Bike's expansion plan would grow ridership by 92{\%}, and if they were able to expand efficiently throughout NYC this would grow further to 210{\%} over the baseline.},

	abstract = {Data holders can produce synthetic versions of data sets when concerns about potential disclosure restrict the availability of the original records. The paper is concerned with methods to judge whether such synthetic data have a distribution that is comparable with that of the original data: what we term general utility. We consider how general utility compares with specific utility: the similarity of results of analyses from the synthetic data and the original data. We adapt a previous general measure of data utility, the propensity score mean-squared error pMSE, to the specific case of synthetic data and derive its distribution for the case when the correct synthesis model is used to create the synthetic data. Our asymptotic results are confirmed by a simulation study. We also consider two specific utility measures, confidence interval overlap and standardized difference in summary statistics, which we compare with the general utility results. We present two contrasting examples of data syntheses: one illustrating synthetic data that is evaluated as being useful by both general and specific measures and the second where neither is the case. For the second case we show how the general utility measures can identify the deficiencies of the synthetic data and suggest how this can inform possible improvements to the synthesis method.},

@article{Sun:2018aa,
	abstract = {Synthetic population is a key input to agent-based urban/transportation microsimulation models. The objective of population synthesis is to reproduce the underlying statistical properties of real population based on available microsamples and marginal distributions. However, characterizing the joint associations among a large set of attributes is challenging because of the curse of dimensionality, in particular when attributes are organized in a hierarchical household-individual structure. In this paper, we use a hierarchical mixture model to characterize the joint distribution of both household and individual attributes. Based on this model, we propose a framework of generating representative household structures in population synthesis. The framework integrates three models: (1) probabilistic tensor factorization, (2) multilevel latent class model, and (3) rejection sampling. With this framework, one can generalize not only the associations of within- and cross-level attributes, but also reproduce structural relationships among household members (e.g., husband-wife). As a case study, we implement this framework based on the household interview travel survey (HITS) data of Singapore, and then use the inferred model to generate a synthetic population pool. This model demonstrates great potential in reproducing the underlying statistical distribution of real population. The generated synthetic population can serve as a replacement for census in developing agent-based models, with privacy and confidentiality being protected and preserved.},

Forty-five synthetic populations were generated for 12 census tracts in Florida for this purpose. The empirical results indicate the value of synthesizing base-year populations more accurately by accommodating multi-level controls. Although fewer controls are typically available for target years, the use of multi-level controls in the target year with appropriate synthesis methods does benefit the accuracy of the synthetic population. This study also establishes that the magnitude of the overall error in the synthesized population appears to be linearly related to the magnitude of the input errors introduced via the control tables. The improvements in accuracy are statistically significant and hold after controlling for differences in population sizes and growth rates for the different census tracts. Overall, efforts to accurately synthesize base-year populations and to good forecasts of target-year controls can help synthesize accurate target-year populations.},

	n2 = {Microsimulation models that simulate travel demand at the level of individual travelers have been gaining increasing interest among practitioners. Transportation planning agencies across the country are steadily migrating to activity-based microsimulation models, which provide considerable flexibility when testing policy scenarios. Generating a synthetic population is the first step in the application of any activity-based model system and has therefore been a topic of extensive research in the activity-based modeling arena. Several researchers have developed population synthesizers that can generate synthetic populations and can match household- and person-level constraints at a specified geographic resolution (e.g., a census block group). However, although information for some control variables may be available at the specified spatial resolution, information for other control variables may be available only at a more aggregate spatial resolution. Ignoring control variables at different levels of spatial resolution could result in the generation of a synthetic population that would not be representative of the underlying population. However, there has been limited progress in the development of synthetic population generators that are capable of accommodating control variables at multiple spatial resolutions. This paper proposes a robust approach to control for constraints at multiple geographic resolutions when generating a synthetic population. The method is an extension of the iterative proportional updating algorithm previously proposed and implemented by the authors. A case study demonstrating the efficacy of the enhanced algorithm is presented.},

	abstract = {Two central and interconnected problems arise in the specification of a ``complete''path-based route choice model: choice-set generation and choice from a choice set. Choice-set generation poses a significant challenge in personalization and the enumeration of the full choice set with large size. Despite the continued prevalence of classic econometric models for modeling choices within a given set, this requirement of knowledge-driven modeling necessitates explicit model structures and intricate domain knowledge, which may result in practical biases. In this study, a Conditional Variational AutoEncoder (CVAE)-based choice set generation model is developed, which approximates the probability distribution of the underlying choice set generation process conditional on individual and OD characteristics without relying on expert knowledge. In order to facilitate a friendly integration between knowledge-driven econometric and machine learning approaches, a neural-embedded route choice model (IAP-NERCM) with implicit availability/perception (IAP) of choice alternatives is proposed to automatically capture the heterogeneity of taste parameters without assuming any a priori relationship. Results based on synthetic data show that the proposed models are capable of reproducing the pre-defined coefficients. Field data of GPS data collected in Toyota City is used to future test the proposed models compared to classical statistical models. Results indicate that IAP-NERCM exhibits the ability to recover underlying taste function and achieves the best performance in terms of goodness-of-fit, predictability, and estimation time.},

	abstract = {Choice set generation is a challenging task, since the consideration set is generally unknown to the modelers, and the full choice set could be too large to be enumerated. The proposed variational autoencoder approach (VAE) is motivated by the idea that the chosen alternatives must belong to the consideration set. The proposed VAE method explicitly considers maximizing the likelihood of including the chosen alternatives in the choice set and inferring the underlying generation process. This paper derives the generalized extreme value (GEV) model with implicit availability/perception (IAP) of alternatives, for bridging the VAE with choice modeling. Specifically, the cross-nested logit (CNL) model with IAP is derived as an example of IAP-GEV models. The IAP approach assumes each alternative is associated with an implicit degree of availability/perception (likelihood in the context of VAE) to be included in the choice set. The VAE approach for route choice set generation is illustrated in a toy network. Simulation experiments show that the proposed method could reproduce the pre-defined true values. We further exemplify the VAE approach using a real dataset. The IAP-CNL model estimated has the best performance in terms of goodness-of-fit and prediction performance, compared to multinomial logit models and conventional choice set generation methods.},

@article{Shiftan:2011aa,
	abstract = {The development of activity-based models as a tool to analyse travel behaviour and forecast transport demand has been motivated by the growing complexity in activity patterns resulting from socio-economic changes, growing congestion, and negative externalities, as well as the need to estimate changes in travel behaviour in response to innovative policies designed to achieve sustainability. This paper reviews how the trade-off between behavioural realism and complexity, one of the main challenges facing the travel-demand modeler, is made in the best practical activity-based models. It proposes an approach that captures key behavioural aspects and policy sensitivities, while remaining practical with reasonable requirements of computational resources. The three main model elements in this trade-off---model structure, data, and application method---are analysed. Drawing on examples from a model developed for Tel Aviv and from existing US models, this paper shows that behavioural realism and policy sensitivity can be achieved with a reasonable level of model complexity.},

	abstract = {This paper describes the conceptual development, operatonalization and empirical testing of Albatross: A Learning-based Transportation Oriented Simulation System. This activity-based model of activity-travel behavior is derived from theories of choice heuristics that consumers apply when making decisions in complex environments. The model, one of the most comprehensive of its kind, predicts which activities are conducted when, where, for how long, with whom, and the transport mode involved. In addition, various situational, temporal, spatial, spatial-temporal and institutional constraints are incorporated in the model. The decision tree is proposed as a formalism to represent an exhaustive set of mutually exclusive rules for each decision step in the model. A CHAID decision tree induction method is used to derive decision trees from activity diary data. The case study conducted to develop and test the model indicates that performance of the model is very satisfactory. We conclude therefore that the methodology proposed in this article is useful to develop computational process models of activity-travel choice behavior.},

	abstract = {Identifying the spatio-temporal patterns of people activities in urban areas is key to effective urban planning; it can be used in real-estate projects to predict their future impacts on behavior in surrounding accessible areas. LaVall{\'e}e is a large construction project recently started in Paris's suburb; it is a new district due in 2024. The paper is in the field of urban planning, aiming at developing a method making it possible to model the potential visits of the various equipment and public spaces of the district, by mobilizing data from census at the departmental level, and the layout of shops and activities as defined by the real-estate project. This model takes into account the flow of external visitors, estimated realistically based on the pre-project movements in the areas of influence of LaVall{\'e}e. In this paper, we propose an activity-based model methodology to determine trips and their purpose at a mesoscopic scale including the city and surrounding areas, in the current baseline scenario. This travel demand is required to estimate potential external visitors of the future district. A first demonstration shows that the model correctly represents the current demands and allows the forecast of future demand in the area.},

Even when technical solutions, political commitments, and funding streams are avaiable, implementation often remains siloed and fragmented. This debate piece does not present definitive solutions or conclusive evidence; rather, it aims to foster critical reflection on how co-design, participatory approaches, Living Labs, and epistemically connected actor coalitions may help break down institutional and conceptual barriers. It proposes the SCALE framework {$[$}Shared epistemic foundations, Cross-sectoral integration, Adaptive co-design, Local enabling environments, and Evaluation \& expansion) as way of operationalising the Safe Systems for Sustainable Development concept presented in Lah 2024, exploring how knowledge integration, iterative experimentation, and locally grounded solutuions can help creating implementation partnerships that last. This approach highlights questions concerning resource intensity, longevity, and scalability that must be addressed. By facilitating co-design, testing and validation of concrete solutions at the local level, the approach presented in this paper invites policymakers, researchers, practitioners, and civil society actors to engage in a more nuanced and constructive debate on whether, how, and under what conditions sustainable development solutions are considered to be viable and hence can endure even in politically volatile environments.},

@article{Zhuge:2021aa,
	abstract = {Coupling activity-based models with dynamic traffic assignment appears to form a promising approach to investigating travel demand. However, such an integrated framework is generally time-consuming, especially for large-scale scenarios. This paper attempts to improve the performance of these kinds of integrated frameworks through some simple adjustments using MATSim as an example. We focus on two specific areas of the model---replanning and time stepping. In the first case we adjust the scoring system for agents to use in assessing their travel plans to include only agents with low plan scores, rather than selecting agents at random, as is the case in the current model. Secondly, we vary the model time step to account for network loading in the execution module of MATSim. The city of Baoding, China is used as a case study. The performance of the proposed methods was assessed through comparison between the improved and original MATSim, calibrated using Cadyts. The results suggest that the first solution can significantly decrease the computing time at the cost of slight increase of model error, but the second solution makes the improved MATSim outperform the original one, both in terms of computing time and model accuracy; Integrating all new proposed methods takes still less computing time and obtains relatively accurate outcomes, compared with those only incorporating one new method.},

@article{Liu:2014aa,
	abstract = {Activity-based micro-simulation transportation models typically predict 24-h activity-travel sequences for each individual in a study area. These sequences serve as a key input for travel demand analysis and forecasting in the region. However, despite their importance, the lack of a reliable benchmark to evaluate the generated sequences has hampered further development and application of the models. With the wide deployment of mobile phone devices today, we explore the possibility of using the travel behavioral information derived from mobile phone data to build such a validation measure. Our investigation consists of three steps. First, the daily trajectory of locations, where a user performed activities, is constructed from the mobile phone records. To account for the discrepancy between the stops revealed by the call data and the real location traces that the user has made, the daily trajectories are then transformed into actual travel sequences. Finally, all the derived sequences are classified into typical activity-travel patterns which, in combination with their relative frequencies, define an activity-travel profile. The established profile characterizes the current activity-travel behavior in the study area, and can thus be used as a benchmark for the assessment of the activity-based transportation models. By comparing the activity-travel profiles derived from the call data with statistics that stem from traditional activity-travel surveys, the validation potential is demonstrated. In addition, a sensitivity analysis is carried out to assess how the results are affected by the different parameter settings defined in the profiling process.},

They deal with agents that structure their behaviour in terms of daily activity schedules: sequences of activity instances (such as work, sleep or shopping) with assigned start times, durations and locations, and interconnected by trips with assigned transport modes and routes. Despite growing importance of activity-based models in transport modelling, there has been no work focusing specifically on statistical validation of such models so far. In this paper, we propose a six-step Validation Framework for Activity-based Models (VALFRAM) that exploits historical real-world data to quantify the model's validity in terms of a set of numeric metrics. The framework compares the temporal and spatial properties and the structure of modelled activity schedules against real-world origin-destination matrices and travel diaries. We demonstrate the usefulness of the framework on a set of six different activity-based transport models.},

This paper highlights a framework that actively links travel demand models in general and activity-based models in particular with traffic counts. Two approaches are presented that calibrate activity-based models with traffic count?an indirect and a direct approach. The indirect approach tries to incorporate findings based on the analysis of traffic counts into the components of the activity-based models. The direct approach calibrates the parameters of the travel demand model in such a way that the model replicates the observed traffic counts (quasi-) perfectly. A practical example is provided to illustrate the direct approach. The study area for this practical example is Hasselt, Belgium, a city of about 70,000 residents, and its surrounding municipalities. The practical examples revealed not a single roadway to success in calibrating activity-based models, but different options exist in fine-tuning the activity-based model. It is important to recognize some open issues and avenues for further research. First, it is not always appropriate to assume that traffic counts are completely correct. Setting up some belief structure might increase the responsiveness of the activity-based model. In addition, the origin-destination matrix calibration that optimizes the correspondence between estimated and observed screen-line counts could negatively affect the correspondence to other measures, such as vehicle miles traveled. To conclude, the formulation of a multiobjective calibration method is a key challenge for further research.},

Flight times for 25,993 private aircraft and 18,655,789 individual flights in 2019-2023 are linked to 72 aircraft models and their average fuel consumption. We find that private aviation contributed at least 15.6 Mt CO2 in direct emissions in 2023, or about 3.6 t CO2 per flight. Almost half of all flights (47.4{\%}) are shorter than 500 km. Private aviation is concentrated in the USA, where 68.7{\%} of the aircraft are registered. Flight pattern analysis confirms extensive travel for leisure purposes, and for cultural and political events.

	abstract = {Discussion and analysis on international climate policy often focuses on the rather abstract level of total national and regional greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. At some point, however, emission reductions need to be translated to consumption level. In this article, we evaluate the implications of the strictest IPCC representative concentration pathway for key consumption categories (food, travel, shelter, goods, services). We use IPAT style identities to account for possible growth in global consumption levels and indicate the required change in GHG emission intensity for each category (i.e. GHG emission per calorie, person kilometer, square meter, kilogram, US dollar). The proposed concept provides guidance for product developers, consumers and policymakers. To reach the 2 $\,^{\circ}$C climate target (2.1 tCO2-eq. per capita in 2050), the GHG emission intensity of consumption has to be reduced by a factor of 5 in 2050. The climate targets on consumption level allow discussion of the feasibility of this climate target at product and consumption level. In most consumption categories products in line with this climate target are available. For animal food and air travel, reaching the GHG intensity targets with product modifications alone will be challenging and therefore structural changes in consumption patterns might be needed. The concept opens up possibilities for further research on potential solutions on the consumption and product level to global climate mitigation.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates the potential for making deep cuts in US transportation greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the long-term (50--80{\%} below 1990 levels by 2050). Scenarios are used to envision how such a significant decarbonization might be achieved through the application of advanced vehicle technologies and fuels, and various options for behavioral change. A Kaya framework that decomposes GHG emissions into the product of four major drivers is used to analyze emissions and mitigation options. In contrast to most previous studies, a relatively simple, easily adaptable modeling methodology is used which can incorporate insights from other modeling studies and organize them in a way that is easy for policymakers to understand. Also, a wider range of transportation subsectors is considered here---light- and heavy-duty vehicles, aviation, rail, marine, agriculture, off-road, and construction. This analysis investigates scenarios with multiple options (increased efficiency, lower-carbon fuels, and travel demand management) across the various subsectors and confirms the notion that there are no ``silver bullet''strategies for making deep cuts in transport GHGs. If substantial emission reductions are to be made, considerable action is needed on all fronts, and no subsectors can be ignored. Light-duty vehicles offer the greatest potential for emission reductions; however, while deep reductions in other subsectors are also possible, there are more limitations in the types of fuels and propulsion systems that can be used. In all cases travel demand management strategies are critical; deep emission cuts will not likely be possible without slowing growth in travel demand across all modes. Even though these scenarios represent only a small subset of the potential futures in which deep reductions might be achieved, they provide a sense of the magnitude of changes required in our transportation system and the need for early and aggressive action if long-term targets are to be met.},

Here, we provide a contrasting perspective by developing a narrative of future change based on observable trends that results in low energy demand. We describe and quantify changes in activity levels and energy intensity in the global North and global South for all major energy services. We project that global final energy demand by 2050 reduces to 245 EJ, around 40{\%} lower than today, despite rises in population, income and activity. Using an integrated assessment modelling framework, we show how changes in the quantity and type of energy services drive structural change in intermediate and upstream supply sectors (energy and land use). Down-sizing the global energy system dramatically improves the feasibility of a low-carbon supply-side transformation. Our scenario meets the 1.5 $\,^{\circ}$C climate target as well as many sustainable development goals, without relying on negative emission technologies.},

	abstract = {Car use imposes costly environmental externalities. We investigate to what extent car trips could be shifted to low-emission modes, avoided via teleworking, or improved via a transition to electric vehicles in the context of daily mobility in the Paris area. We derive counterfactual travel times for 45,000 car trips from a representative transport survey, and formulate modal shift scenarios including a maximum acceptable increase in travel time. For a daily travel time increase below 10 min, 46{\%} of drivers could shift to e-bike --mostly --or public transit --rarely --, with half of them benefiting from a travel time decrease. Such modal shift would reduce daily mobility emissions by 15{\%} and generate annual climate and health benefits worth €125 million. Factors such as living in the far suburbs, being male, or having a high income, are associated with inability to shift modes. Teleworking two days a week could save an additional 5{\%} of emissions. Holding demand for mobility and public transport infrastructure fixed, greater emission reductions require improving cars' environmental performance via a transition to electric vehicles.},

@article{Requena:2025aa,
	abstract = {Environmental values are commonly explained through three theories: post-materialism suggests affluence enables environmental concern, materialism argues environmental harm drives concern, while disconnection theory posits economic growth creates both concern and degradation. We test these frameworks at two levels. First, using aggregate U.S. time-series data (1990--2021), and Vector Autoregression Analysis (VAR) analysis to examine how resource use and environmental impact, economic growth and concern are related. We show that these three theories can complement each other. Both material and carbon footprint growth lead to subsequent GDP growth, supporting materialist views. GDP growth then increases environmental concern, aligning with post-materialist predictions. This causal chain supports disconnection theory: the very process that generates environmental concern - economic growth - simultaneously intensifies environmental degradation. Second, at the individual level (2000−2023), we examine how income relates to environmental preferences and impacts. Contrary to post-materialist expectations of wealthy groups showing greater environmental concern, logistic regression analysis controlling for sociodemographic variables reveals lower-income groups consistently prioritize environmental protection over economic growth. Carbon emissions analysis reveals that carbon footprint inequality among income groups has been rapidly increasing, with the p99/p50 income ratio rising since 1990. By 2019, top1{\%} of income emitted 250 COeq/t per capita and bottom 50 {\%} only 10 COeq/t per capita, while lower-income groups consistently rate environmental conditions as poor and worsening, further supporting materialist theories linking environmental harm to concern. At the societal level, our findings reveal that environmental concern is structurally intertwined with economic growth---a process that simultaneously drives environmental degradation and poses significant challenges for degrowth transitions. In contrast, at the individual level, lower-income groups consistently prioritize environmental protection over economic growth while exhibiting a lower environmental impact. This pattern suggests the potential for a ``degrowth from below,''initiated by low-income individuals whose heightened preference for environmental protection directly reflects their experience of poor and worsening environmental conditions.},

This literature review focuses on the different approaches and supporting measures of urban transport land-use planning, such as mixed-used zoning plans and the compact city approach. These solutions can increase the modal shift towards zero emissions transport options. They can also reduce reliance on private vehicles and bring co-benefits and positive externalities to urban residents. Many barriers exist for policymakers, such as financial limitations or institutional immobility. Nevertheless, innovative approaches such as Artificial Intelligence and Mobility-as-a-service provide new perspectives for policymakers and can be helpful in the fight against climate change.},

@misc{Lempert:2022aa,
	abstract = {Transportation agencies must pursue ambitious goals in the face of intense, large-scale, and increasingly fast-paced change. They are also mandated to produce regular planning documents. But those documents have diminishing credence in the face of rapid and uncertain change, and the means used to produce them have difficulty in supporting more far-reaching strategic deliberation. Traditional planning methods, designed to use simulation models to provide future reliable demand forecasts, may often prove less sufficient than in the past. Such ``predict-then-act''analyses can foster over-confidence and so limit consideration of strategic alternatives or the range of plausible future conditions. Planners and modelers might arrive at myopic decisions because they underestimate the uncertainty. Predict-then-act analyses can lead to gridlock when stakeholders contest the assumptions used to justify a proposed plan rather than work together to identify a plan that performs well over a wide range of scenarios. MPOs now have available emerging methods and tools for decision making under conditions of deep uncertainty (DMDU). DMDU approaches can help planners and modelers augment their current modeling capabilities to identify and evaluate strategies that can help their agencies meet goals in the face of today's fast-paced change. DMDU methods use simulation models not as prediction engines but as exploratory tools. DMDU methods may therefore run an MPO's simulation models or their surrogates over a range of plausible futures to stress-test proposed plans and then use the results of those stress-tests to identify strategies that are low-regret, flexible in their ability to adjust over time, and shape the future along pathways consistent with desirable policy outcomes. DMDU use in MPOs has to date been limited, in part owing to both analytic and organizational challenges. Based on experiences interacting with MPO planning and modeling staffs, this report summarizes DMDU analytics, stakeholder processes supported by DMDU, and offers guidance for agencies interested in bringing such methods into their organization. The report first introduces the DMDU concept which embraces a range of quantitative and qualitative methods. In particular, the report discusses in detail robust decision making (RDM), a specific model-based DMDU method that recommends itself as being potentially consonant with model-based analysis currently practiced in MPOs and other transportation agencies. The report reviews the methods and quantitative tools available to support MPOs in using RDM including the participatory processes with stakeholders supported by the analyses and the software packages available to facilitate RDM analyses. The report describes case studies of RDM and other quantitative and qualitative DMDU applications which have been employed by MPOs. The report concludes with an organizational perspective of MPOs and their transportation planning functions. It lays out a value proposition for enhanced strategic foresight capabilities --the goal that DMDU methods seek to achieve, lays out several of the obstacles that might retard or prevent movement in that direction, suggests incremental steps toward implementation, and finally provides a guide that may be used by agencies as a whole or their modeling or planning staffs to gauge progress toward achieving a greater facility for accounting for and managing future uncertainties as part of their regular process.},

Examining abatement measures in isolation, however, fails to capture their interactive effects within the energy system. Here we show the abatement costs of decarbonization in the United States using an energy system optimization model to capture technological interactions, multi-decadal path dependence, and endogenous end-use technology selection. Energy-system-wide net-zero CO2-eq emissions are achieved in 2050 at a cost under {\$}400 per tonne CO2-eq, led by emissions reductions in power generation, end-use electrification of ground transportation, space heating, and some industrial applications. Differences in mitigation costs and CO2 geological storage potential lead to regional heterogeneities in mitigation rates and residual emissions. The marginal abatement cost curves show that additional decarbonization comes at higher incremental costs, this cost penalty decreases over time, and substantially greater abatement occurs in future time periods at the same abatement cost.},

@article{Enam:2018aa,
	abstract = {In the recent years, multiple discrete continuous (MDC) models have emerged as a popular framework to simultaneously model the choice of multiple goods (that are imperfect substitutes to one another) and the associated consumption quantities. The paper presents a new integrated choice and latent variable (ICLV) model implementation called the Hybrid Multiple Discrete Continuous (HMDC) model that is capable of incorporating the influence of psychological factors (modeled as latent constructs) on MDC choice behaviors. Estimation of ICLV models (with single discrete choice kernels and MDC kernels) has been a challenge owing to the high dimensional integrals involved in the likelihood function. The typically used maximum simulated likelihood estimation (MSLE) approach becomes cumbersome when the dimensionality of integration increases. In this research, a composite marginal likelihood (CML) based estimation approach is proposed for parameter estimation of the HMDC framework. Unlike the ICLV model implementations with single discrete choice kernel, the dimension of the integral to be decomposed in the HMDC varies across observations. This necessitated the use of weights when decomposing the likelihood function using the CML approach. A simulation study was conducted using synthetic datasets to demonstrate the superiority of the weighted CML approach over its unweighted counterpart in the presence of MDC choice kernel. The applicability of the proposed model formulation and associated estimation routine was demonstrated using an empirical case study with data from the 2013 American Time Use Survey (ATUS). The empirical study identifies interesting association between day level moods and discretionary activity participation decisions.},

Activity-based models overcome many of the limitations of the trip-based model, but implementing and calibrating an activity-based model is labor-intensive and running an activity-based model often takes long runtimes. This paper proposes a hybrid called MITO (Microsimulation Transport Orchestrator) that overcomes some of the limitations of trip-based models, yet is easier to implement than an activity-based model. MITO uses microsimulation to simulate each household and person individually. After trip generation, the travel time budget in minutes is calculated for every household. This budget influences destination choice; i.e., people who spent a lot of time commuting are less likely to do much other travel, while people who telecommute might compensate by additional discretionary travel. Mode choice uses a nested logit model, and time-of-day choice schedules trips in 1-minute intervals. Three case studies demonstrate how individuals may be traced through the entire model system from trip generation to the assignment.},

@article{Nguyen_2025aa,
	abstract = {Large-scale, activity-based microscopic transport models provide a powerful framework for analyzing dynamic travel demand and assessing the impact of transportation policies on daily travel behavior. At the core of these models is the generation of travel demand, which necessitates the creation of detailed synthetic populations and daily travel plans associated with personalized activities. These time-dependent travel plans are then integrated into dynamic traffic assignment models to simulate agent-based systems. This paper presents a comprehensive review of existing demand generation models within activity-based frameworks, focusing on various methodologies including constraint-based, utility-based, rule-based, learning-based, and hybrid approaches. A comparative analysis is offered, highlighting their theoretical foundations, data requirements, key outputs, and particularly their applications in large-scale microsimulations. In addition, the paper discusses the possibility of collecting input data for these models, as well as explores innovative approaches capable of modeling daily mobility patterns as sequences of activities linked by trips, offering greater flexibility in capturing dynamic travel behavior. Furthermore,potential research directions are also discussed, including the development of travel models for large-scale scenarios using big data sources and the optimization of their integration with dynamic traffic assignment. These methods hold significant promise for integration into large-scale, microscopic dynamic traffic assignment platforms. This study provides critical insights for researchers and practitioners focused on advancing large-scale microscopic traffic modeling to improve decision-making processes.},

Our method is an extension of previous results for Logit and MEV models. We show that the practical application of the proposed method for Logit Mixture can result in a Na{\"\i}ve approach, in which the kernel is replaced by the usual sampling correction for Logit. We give theoretical support for previous applications of the Na{\"\i}ve approach, showing not only that it yields consistent estimators, but also providing its asymptotic distribution for proper hypothesis testing. We illustrate the proposed method using Monte Carlo experimentation and real data. Results provide further evidence that the Na{\"\i}ve approach is suitable and practical.

	abstract = {Our paper deals with inferring simulator-based statistical models given some observed data. A simulator-based model is a parametrized mechanism which specifies how data are generated. It is thus also referred to as generative model. We assume that only a finite number of parameters are of interest and allow the generative process to be very general; it may be a noisy nonlinear dynamical system with an unrestricted number of hidden variables. This weak assumption is useful for devising realistic models but it renders statistical inference very difficult. The main challenge is the intractability of the likelihood function. Several likelihood-free inference methods have been proposed which share the basic idea of identifying the parameters by finding values for which the discrepancy between simulated and observed data is small. A major obstacle to using these methods is their computational cost. The cost is largely due to the need to repeatedly simulate data sets and the lack of knowledge about how the parameters affect the discrepancy. We propose a strategy which combines probabilistic modeling of the discrepancy with optimization to facilitate likelihood-free inference. The strategy is implemented using Bayesian optimization and is shown to accelerate the inference through a reduction in the number of required simulations by several orders of magnitude.},

A second step, based on simulations, provides a consistent and asymptotically normal estimator of the parameter of interest. Various testing procedures are also proposed. The methods described in this paper only require that the model can be simulated, therefore they should be useful for models whose complexity rules out a direct approach.

	abstract = {When estimating multinomial logit (MNL) models where choices are made from a large set of available alternatives computational benefits can be achieved by estimating a quasi-likelihood function based on a sampled subset of alternatives in combination with `McFadden's correction factor'. In this paper, we theoretically prove that McFadden's correction factor minimises the expected information loss in the parameters of interest and thereby has convenient finite (and large sample) properties. That is, in the context of Bayesian estimation the use of sampling of alternatives in combination with McFadden's correction factor provides the best approximation of the posterior distribution for the parameters of interest irrespective of sample size. As sample sizes become sufficiently large consistent point estimates for MNL can be obtained as per McFadden's original proof. McFadden's correction factor can therefore effectively be applied in the context of Bayesian MNL models. We extend these results to the context of mixed multinomial logit models (MMNL) by using the property of data augmentation in Bayesian estimation. McFadden's correction factor minimises the expected information loss with respect to the augmented individual-level parameters, and in turn also for the population parameters characterising the shape and location of the mixing density in MMNL. Again, the results apply to finite and large samples and most importantly circumvent the need for additional correction factors previously identified for estimating MMNL models using maximum simulated likelihood. Monte Carlo simulations validate this result for sampling of alternatives in Bayesian MMNL models.},

	abstract = {Quasi-random number sequences have been used extensively for many years in the simulation of integrals that do not have a closed-form expression, such as Mixed Logit and Multinomial Probit choice probabilities. Halton sequences are one example of such quasi-random number sequences, and various types of Halton sequences, including standard, scrambled, and shuffled versions, have been proposed and tested in the context of travel demand modeling. In this paper, we propose an alternative to Halton sequences, based on an adapted version of Latin Hypercube Sampling. These alternative sequences, like scrambled and shuffled Halton sequences, avoid the undesirable correlation patterns that arise in standard Halton sequences. However, they are easier to create than scrambled or shuffled Halton sequences. They also provide more uniform coverage in each dimension than any of the Halton sequences. A detailed analysis, using a 16-dimensional Mixed Logit model for choice between alternative-fuelled vehicles in California, was conducted to compare the performance of the different types of draws. The analysis shows that, in this application, the Modified Latin Hypercube Sampling (MLHS) outperforms each type of Halton sequence. This greater accuracy combined with the greater simplicity make the MLHS method an appealing approach for simulation of travel demand models and simulation-based models in general.},

The activity pattern consists of important decisions that provide overall structure for the day's activities and travel. In the prototype the activity pattern includes (a) the primary --most important --activity of the day, with one alternative being to remain at home for all the day's activities; (b) the type of tour for the primary activity, including the number, purpose and sequence of activity stops; and (c) the number and purpose of secondary --additional --tours. Tour models include the choice of time of day, destination and mode of travel, and are conditioned by the choice of activity pattern. The choice of activity pattern is influenced by the expected maximum utility derived from the available tour alternatives.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a trial aimed at reducing parking demand at a large urban employer through an informational campaign and monetary incentives. A 6-week randomized controlled trial was conducted with (N = 2000) employee commuters at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, all of whom frequently drove to campus. Split into four arms of five hundred each, one group received weekly informational emails highlighting MIT's various new transportation benefits; a second group received monetary rewards for reducing their frequency of parking; a third group received both interventions, while a control group was monitored with no intervention. The paper aims to examine how behavioral incentives, namely targeted information provision and monetary rewards, can be used independently or in combination to encourage alternatives to drive-alone commuting. Success was measured as the extent to which drivers decreased their frequency of parking and increased their use of alternative modes during and after the campaign. While the combined treatment group contained the highest number of top-performing participants, no statistically significant differences-in-differences were observed amongst the treatment arms compared to the control. A post-experiment survey indicated a widespread increase in awareness of employer transportation benefits, and a much larger stated shift from driving towards transit than was supported by passively-collected data. Survey results suggested that while intent to reduce car use existed, complaints of insufficient quality of transit service and relative convenience of driving suppressed modal shifts. Most importantly, the discrepancy between self-reported and actual behavior change highlights important limitations and biases of survey-based travel behavior research.},

@article{McConnell:2021aa,
	abstract = {AbstractCalifornia?s long-running Zero Emissions Vehicle (ZEV) program represents a unique policy approach for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector. It mandates that manufacturers sell passenger cars and trucks that have zero tailpipe emissions, which in today?s market are electrified vehicles, including battery electric and fuel cell vehicles. The policy, when it was initiated in 1990, was technology forcing because such zero emission vehicles had not yet been produced. We discuss the motivation for such a technology policy and briefly summarize the 30-year history of this evolving program.

It mandates that manufacturers sell passenger cars and trucks that have zero tailpipe emissions, which in today?s market are electrified vehicles, including battery electric and fuel cell vehicles. The policy, when it was initiated in 1990, was technology forcing because such zero emission vehicles had not yet been produced. We discuss the motivation for such a technology policy and briefly summarize the 30-year history of this evolving program. We examine evidence on the extent of innovation in electrification technologies under the program and trends in battery and vehicle costs and sales. We review the flexibility granted under the ZEV credit-trading program and estimate the value of ZEV credits traded among manufacturers.

@article{Flachsland:2011aa,
	abstract = {Current policies in the road transport sector fail to deliver consistent and efficient incentives for greenhouse gas abatement (see companion article by Creutzig et al., in press). Market-based instruments such as cap-and-trade systems close this policy gap and complement traditional policies that are required where specific market failures arise. Even in presence of strong existing non-market policies, cap-and-trade delivers additional abatement and efficiency by incentivizing demand side abatement options. This paper analyzes generic design options and economic impacts of including the European road transport sector into the EU ETS. Suitable points of regulation are up- and midstream in the fuel chain to ensure effectiveness (cover all emissions and avoid double-counting), efficiency (incentivize all abatement options) and low transaction costs. Based on year 2020 marginal abatement cost curves from different models and current EU climate policy objectives we show that in contrast to conventional wisdom, road transport inclusion would not change the EU ETS allowance price. Hence, industrial carbon leakage induced by adding road transport to the EU ETS may be less important than previously estimated.},

	abstract = {Collecting accurate travel data is vital for transportation planning purposes. Regional travel demand forecasts as well as transportation system analyses depend on datasets that provide origins and destinations of travel for various modes, purposes of travel, socio-economic characteristics of the system users, and other attributes critical for understanding travel demand. GPS-based household travel surveys emerged as a state-of-the-practice method to collect travel data with increased accuracy and detail. The Maricopa Association of Governments conducted a survey utilizing Future Mobility Sensing (FMS) technology. One hundred percent of the sample was collected with the FMS technology platform that combines mobile sensing through a smartphone app with machine learning and a user interface. The technology enables detailed, multi-day, multimodal, user-verified travel and activity behavior data to be obtained with a reduced burden on participants. The data collected through the survey was analyzed together with a comparable dataset obtained through traditional recall-based collection methods during the same time period. The broad conclusions are that the 100{\%} GPS-based surveys with the FMS technology platform provide greater accuracy, detail and completeness of data, as well as greater flexibility than traditional data collection approaches that rely on participant recall. Emphasis was made on comparative analyses between traditionally collected data and the GPS survey with the FMS technology. The paper systematically identifies and explains differences and provides original analyses that can inform future decision making relevant to similar data collection exercises. The method is particularly applicable for monitoring mobility in the ongoing conditions of rapidly changing travel behavior, especially due to the COVID-19 pandemic.},

@article{Xie:2024aa,
	abstract = {The design of dynamic tolling algorithms for managed lanes is complex and challenging, in part due to the often conflicting and differing objectives of the operator, travelers and the regulator. In this paper, we propose a framework for personalized pricing of managed lanes that combines elements of prediction, optimization, and personalization to dynamically determine displayed tolls and personalized discounts to travelers. The proposed approach involves an online bi-level optimization formulation consisting of coupled system-level and user-level optimization problems. The system optimization problem uses real-time traffic predictions (from a simulation-based dynamic traffic assignment model) to periodically determine displayed tolls and a discount control policy that maximize a multi-component system-level objective (considering different stakeholders with flexible policy hyperparameters). The user optimization problem consistently determines a personalized discount to offer to each individual traveler based on individual-specific preferences subject to the displayed toll and discount policy in effect. At the heart of both the system and user optimization problems is an individual-specific behavioral model (of choice between the managed lane and general purpose lanes) that incorporates state dependence (habit and loyalty formation), unobserved inter- and intra-consumer heterogeneity, and corrections for price endogeneity. Rigorous closed-loop simulations of an operational managed lane facility using real data demonstrate that the proposed personalized dynamic tolling approach improves operator revenue and managed lane usage, traveler benefits and equity, and reduces congestion relative to the existing tolling policy.},

	abstract = {This paper assesses the influence of policy-relevant factors for electric vehicle (EV) uptake, while considering the related solar-panel context, using the 2020 Residential Energy Consumption Survey for the U.S. Our results suggest that the link from household income to EV uptake is relatively weak; we find the link from education to EV uptake is stronger. Three policy reforms are suggested based on our analysis of actual household data. If income is used in determining subsidies, then increased targeting of policy support to lower income levels may be warranted. Policymakers may also consider alternative approaches, rather than relying on income thresholds. Policy bundling is also suggested, where households can use subsidies for their chosen energy investment, rather than separate schemes for solar panels and EVs.

	abstract = {Carpooling is emerging as a more appealing ``sharing economy''form with promising benefits in reducing carbon emissions, traveling costs, and traffic congestion. However, a thorough understanding of carpooling adoption is lacking for policymakers and transport planners in developing countries due to limited scientific research, specifically in Southeast Asia. Therefore, the present study aimed to understand the behavioral influences of carpool adoption in Thailand by conducting a multivariate analysis on a dataset of 307 observations gathered at Thammasat University, Pathum Thani, Thailand. First, a conceptual model was developed to assess the influence of effort expectancy, perceived safety, hedonic motivation, and social influence on carpool behavior intention. Additionally, two constructs related to COVID-19 and time credits were added to assess their impacts. Then, the sample data were analyzed using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). It was found that hedonic motivation, social influence, and time credits as payment method factors play statistically significant direct roles in the carpool behavior intention, whereas effort expectancy, perceived safety, and perception towards compliance with COVID-19 guidelines for carpooling did not. However, significant indirect impacts of effort expectancy and social influence through hedonic motivation were discovered. Upon analysis of the findings, policy implications are presented.},

	abstract = {The rebound effect is the phenomenon underlying the disproportionality between energy efficiency improvements and observed energy savings. In road transport, the effect reveals the extent to which energy savings from improved fuel efficiency are forgone due to additional car travel. We present a meta-analysis of 74 primary studies containing 1120 estimates of the direct rebound effect in road transport to evaluate its magnitude and identify its determinants. We find that the short-run rebound effect is, on average, about 10--12{\%}, whereas the long-run effect about 26--29{\%}. However, variation of estimates is large and can mainly be explained by differences in the time horizon considered, the elasticity measure used, and the type of data and econometric approach employed in primary studies. We also find that the rebound effect is declining over time and that lower per capita incomes, higher gasoline prices and higher population density are associated with larger rebound effects.},

The aims of this paper are to evaluate the condition of the road performance and damages and to calculate the remaining service life of the pavement on East Line of South Sumatera, as well as examining the relationship between these two values. This research includes the evaluation of five sections of the route with a various damaged condition and detailed appraisal of road conditions using the Pavement Condition Index (PCI), while the prediction of the remaining service life using the deflection data acquiring from Falling Weight Deflectometer measurements. The correlation of PCI value and remaining life service, intellectually established, created regression model to obtain the relationship and the correlation coefficient. The outcomes demonstrated that the road segments I, II, III, IV, and V have a PCI value of 56.1 (good), 37.8 (poor), 9.3 (very good), 39.0 (poor), and 95.0 (excellent) respectively and the remaining service lives sequentially are 2.39 years, 0.65 years, 4.43 years, 0.11 years and 3.57 years. The correlation between the PCI value and the service life of the pavement is y = 4,1872ln (x) -14.728, with the correlation coefficient is 0.88 which strong level of relationship.},

Impacts on crime, land values, employment and tax revenue are also presented. The results are positive and robust; nevertheless, it is important to recognize that user perception has declined and there is urgent need to introduce service improvements. The paper also includes an ex-ante evaluation of the projected expansion using current costs, which indicates the need to limit construction capital costs. The results are an indication of the potential of BRT, and the evaluation methodology is applicable to other transit projects.},

	n2 = {Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) form a big part of the UK?s agenda for decarbonizing road transport. Although there have been various policies such as purchase grants and vehicle tax exemptions, the BEV penetration rate in the UK was only 2.5{\%} in September 2023. Most research analyzing electric vehicle (EV) ownership in the UK is either based on stated preference survey data or includes plug-in hybrid vehicles in the analysis because of the sparsity of BEV ownership data; there is limited research based on household revealed preference (RP) data. This paper develops a BEV ownership model using RP household-level data from England to discover influential factors, to validate the findings in the literature, or both. Specifically, this paper uses the subset of the UK National Travel Survey (NTS) special license data to estimate a series of binary logit models of BEV ownership as a function of several sociodemographic, regional, and temporal factors, and discusses the related policy implications. Household income, multivehicle ownership (resulting from range anxiety), and overnight parking on street (resulting from insufficient public charging infrastructure) are influential factors found in this study that align with previous studies. On the other hand, households with a mortgage loan, geographical attributes (such as population density), and household composition (e.g., number of adults and children) are new factors identified in this study. We also present a future BEV ownership prediction model for regions of England which clearly suggests that improving public charging infrastructure, especially in the north, is required to achieve widespread growth in BEV ownership.},

	abstract = {This paper explores the geographical and policy context for an emergent business model from Better Place to deliver battery electric car mobility in Denmark. It argues that the combination of radically different technologies and a highly complex multi-agency operating environment theoretically provide the conditions and requirements for such an emergent business model. While focused on battery electric cars, renewable energy generation and smart grids, the paper has wider applicability to an understanding of the interplay between place, innovation and sustainability which suggests that diverse solutions are likely to be the characteristic solution rather than ubiquity and standardization. The paper argues, however, that the innovative business model, the deployment of electric vehicles, and the use of renewable energy systems, in this case largely based on wind power, while mutually supportive and contributing to wider policy aims with respect to the reduction of carbon emissions, may still fail in the face of entrenched practices. At the theoretical level it is concluded that theorization of business models needs a broader perspective beyond the typical `value creation, value capture'rubric to better understand the wider role such models have in meeting societal goals, and to understand the structural impediments to organizational and technical innovation.},

	abstract = {The global drive towards sustainability has ushered in a new era of transportation, prominently featuring the rise of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs). The rapid rise of BEVs has been widely and rightfully hailed as a crucial milestone in promoting sustainable transportation and combating climate change. The existing empirical evidence provides undeniable support for the essential role of BEVs to support net zero targets. However, like most disruptive or emerging technologies, BEVs are not without their hidden effects. This paper seeks to explore and analyse these lesser-known effects, i.e., externalities, of BEV adoption. In doing so, it sheds light on the environmental, infrastructure, socio-economic and safety externalities of BEVs, aiming to promote a holistic understanding of their impact and to facilitate informed policy making. Furthermore, it highlights the critical role of public awareness and user education campaigns in maximising the benefits and mitigating the externalities of BEVs, along with the importance of maintaining a balance of information in developing such campaigns. It is argued that providing individuals and policymakers with accurate information, dispelling misconceptions, and promoting responsible BEV practices are essential for minimising the externalities. At a broader level, these discussions emphasise the importance of moving beyond mere tailpipe emissions towards a holistic, life-cycle-based approach in setting climate-change targets.},

	n2 = {Electric mobility transition has been gradually gaining momentum, driven by several considerations, including the urgency to combat climate change impacts attributed to private transport based on the internal combustion engine. The nature and impacts of such a transition will inevitably vary across countries because of differences in the mobility patterns and preferences in the societies, as well as the policy landscape. In Sub-Saharan Africa, paratransit is one of the dominant forms of transport. This motivates the need to assess its viability for electric mobility transition, focusing on electric motorcycles in particular. Using Kenya as case study, in conjunction with mobility data collected in several Sub-Saharan countries, this research provides insight on the potential adoption and impacts of electric motorcycles in the taxi industry, based on the observed trip characteristics and relative fuel and electricity costs. The economic benefits for taxi drivers as well as the capability of the electricity infrastructure to support such transition are considered. The paper concludes that the transition to electric mobility among motorcycle taxis is feasible in Kenya. The paper also discusses implications for the electricity grid, in relation to the possible increase in the electricity consumption and power needs under various electric two-wheeler proliferation scenarios.},

This paper provides a systematic review of these diverse approaches using a twofold classification of electric vehicle use representation, based on the time scale and on substantive differences in the modelling techniques. For time of day analysis of demand we identify activity-based modelling (ABM) as the most attractive because it provides a framework amenable for integrated cross-sector analyses, required for the emerging integration of the transport and electricity network. However, we find that the current examples of implementation of AMB simulation tools for EV-grid interaction analyses have substantial limitations.

	abstract = {Private car dependence has adverse effects on both mental and physical health. Travel Demand Management (TDM) strategies are adopted by public and private organizations to encourage users to switch to sustainable transport for daily commutes. Originally, mobility management only focused on employees, but recently various universities worldwide have started to adopt policies specifically targeted at students. To improve their effectiveness, an innovative approach to TDM based on a GPS smartphone application is tested at University of RomaTre (Italy) on a sample of students. The strategy identifies the integration of all mobility management activities into one smartphone application called IPET (Individual Persuasive Eco-Travel Technology). The IPET enables activity-travel data collection and automatic processing, personalized information provision, use of persuasive technology and implementation of a gamification system. Two questionnaires were conducted before-and-after the measure, to assess its effects on psycho-attitudinal factors. The main objective of the investigation was to analyze individuals'voluntary behavioral changes with regard to travel mode and everyday behavior following implementation of a personalized travel plan. Data analysis indicated a strong positive change in the level of awareness regarding CO2 emissions and calories burnt after the program implementation. Comparison of GPS data collected in the first and second weeks showed, for those who received a personalized travel plan, an 8.1{\%} shift towards more sustainable transport modes.},

On purpose, Smartphone technologies and platforms are rapidly becoming effective tools for involving citizens in environmental conscious mobility habits. By means of an empirical application to a group of university students, that daily commute for reaching their departments, the effectiveness of a mobile app game in pursuing commuters to modify their mobility behaviors is here checked. The game rewards with tangible prizes the most environmentally sustainable mobility habits, connecting commuters with sponsors and companies operating in the urban context. The field application of the app in the city of Palermo challenges the involved commuters against two benchmarks of mobility behaviors characterized by the use of higher sweet mobility means. The first scenario (apart its applicability as alone) can be seen as a first less challenging step towards the second one. The interesting outcomes of this experimental application encourage paying further attention to such behavioral tools for achieving the smartness of cities.},

	abstract = {In the framework of ``smart city''strategies, cities worldwide are exploiting information and communication technologies to support their efforts in reducing car use. Recent understandings of smart cities suggest to put people at the core, by actively engaging citizens in co-creating innovative urban services. However, notwithstanding the benefits of participatory processes in urban governance are well-known, low receptiveness towards them is still widespread, which can largely hinder the effectiveness of smart city interventions. In this paper we present the experience of a Swiss city, where, against a past background of resistance to participatory processes, a ``living''lab experiment was set for the co-creation of a behavior change app targeting a reduction in car-based traffic. Motivated by the opportunity to overcome limitations of such apps, the lab turned out to deliver wider benefits than initially expected. In fact, the concrete experience of new mobility behaviors stimulated by the app activated a collective learning process among lab participants. Discussions in the lab thus spontaneously scaled-up to far-reaching and potentially conflicting topics about future mobility scenarios. Furthermore, the protected space of the lab favored strengthening of reciprocal trust between citizens and policy-makers, opening-up possibilities for adoption of participatory practices also in future decision-making.},

Processes of social influence can be varied and complex yet are often represented or discussed in a simplified, aggregated manner. To facilitate more nuanced study of social influence, we draw from a literature review and empirical observation to propose a conceptual behavioral framework that integrates three processes of interpersonal influence; we call this the reflexive layers of influence (RLI) framework. RLI proposes three generally successive and iterative ?layers? of the consumer's relation to a new technology (or practice): awareness, assessment, and alignment with self-concept. These layers are antecedents to, and potentially consequences of, adoption and use of proenvironmental technology. Social influence follows different processes at each layer. Awareness is influenced by the diffusion of simple, functional information. The consumer forms an assessment, at least in part, through translating the technology's attributes into specific benefits (or disbenefits). Through reflexivity, the translated assessment of the technology is framed in terms of maintaining, developing, or altering self-concept according to perceptions of others' behaviors and values. We illustrate RLI through application to three case studies of households participating in a multiweek trial of a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle?demonstrating that the consumer's self-concept, perceptions, and behavior can change substantially according to the social processes represented by RLI. We conclude with policy implications and discuss future hypotheses and priorities for research.},

In the context of Sharing Cities, an EU-funded programme aiming to deliver smart city solutions in areas such as citizen participation and infrastructure improvements of buildings and mobility, a prominent intervention has been the deployment and monitoring of a Digital Social Market (DSM) tool in Milan (Italy). The DSM allows cities to engage with residents and encourage sustainable behaviours by offering non-monetary rewards. This paper aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the DSM approach to promote active travel (cycling and walking) by analysing the data collected through the app as well as through participant surveys. Our model results show that a broader engagement with the DSM app (number of claps to posts, number of posts made, non-monetary rewards earned by participating in non-travel events) is positively correlated with the monitored level of active travel. Lifestyles, attitudes, and social influence also explain the variability in cycling and walking. This highlights the importance of investigating these factors when replicating such initiatives on a large scale.},

@article{Manca:2022aa,
	abstract = {This paper presents a conceptual and modelling framework that makes it possible to disentangle and quantify multiple social influence effects affecting the individual's choice behaviour. The proposed structure simultaneously accounts for live social interaction effects, social influence processes of diffusion, translation and reflexivity, conformity processes related to social norms, such as the hypothetical adoption rate within a social network, and correlated effects related to psychometric attitudinal characteristics of peers. The modelling framework is applied to investigate the adoption of bike-sharing in a student cohort during a public transport strike. A joint hybrid choice model is estimated using a two-wave stated preference dataset and incorporating latent variables, social influence measures and live social interactions with dynamic `inertia'processes. In this empirical context, results and sensitivity analyses show that the social influence variables are highly significant and explain part of the heterogeneity in choosing bike-sharing. A greater utility for this travel mode is associated with a greater hypothetical bike-sharing adoption and with live social interactions improving the understanding of the bike-sharing benefits. The results also suggest that conformity processes and social interaction effects can have a higher impact on the choice than correlated effects related to the attitudinal `propensity towards cars'in the social network. This study, therefore, provides further evidence that, in the context of new technology adoptions, the choice is not only driven by explanatory variables that can be generally observed but may well be affected by social factors facilitating the exchange of information and the understanding of the individuals.},

	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic and the consequent travel restrictions have had an unprecedented impact on the air travel market. However, a rigorous analysis of the potential role of safety perceptions and attitudes towards COVID-19 interventions on future air passenger choices has been lacking to date. To investigate this matter, 1469 individuals were interviewed between April and September 2020 in four multi-airport cities (London, New York City, Sao Paulo, Shanghai). The core analysis draws upon data from a set of stated preference (SP) experiments in which respondents were asked to reflect on a hypothetical air travel journey taking place when travel restrictions are lifted but there is still a risk of infection. The hybrid choice model results show that alongside traditional attributes, such as fare, duration and transfer, attitudinal and safety perception factors matter to air passengers when making future air travel choices. The cross-national analysis points towards differences in responses across the cities to stem from culturally-driven attitudes towards interpersonal distance and personal space. We also report the willingness to pay for travel attributes under the expected future conditions and discuss post-pandemic implications for the air travel sector, including video-conferencing as a substitute for air travel.},

	abstract = {The introduction of electric vehicles (EVs) into the passenger vehicle market has, in recent years, become viewed as a primary solution to the significant carbon dioxide emissions attributed to personal mobility. Moreover, EVs offer a means by which energy diversification and efficiency can be improved compared to the current system. The UK government and European Commission have played an active role in steering the development and market introduction of EVs. However, a great deal of uncertainty remains regarding the effectiveness of these policies and the viability of EV technology in the mainstream automotive market. This paper investigates the prevalence of uncertainty concerning the demand for EVs. This is achieved through the application of a conceptual framework that assesses the locations of uncertainty. UK and EU documents are assessed through a review of the published policy alongside contributions from academia to determine how uncertainty has been reduced. This assessment offers insights to decision makers in this area by evaluating the work done to date through a landscape analysis. Results have identified six different locations of uncertainty covering: consumer, policy, infrastructure, technical, economic and social issues.},

	abstract = {The aim of this work is to develop a qualitative picture of the personal income distribution. Treating an economy as a self-organized system the key idea of the model is that the income distribution contains competitive and non-competitive contributions. The presented model distinguishes between three main income classes. 1. Capital income from private firms is shown to be the result of an evolutionary competition between products. A direct consequence of this competition is Gibrat's law suggesting a lognormal income distribution for small private firms. Taking into account an additional preferential attachment mechanism for large private firms the income distribution is supplemented by a power law (Pareto) tail. 2. Due to the division of labor a diversified labor market is seen as a non-competitive market. In this case wage income exhibits an exponential distribution. 3. Also included is income from a social insurance system. It can be approximated by a Gaussian peak. A consequence of this theory is that for short time intervals a fixed ratio of total labor (total capital) to net income exists (Cobb--Douglas relation). A comparison with empirical high resolution income data confirms this pattern of the total income distribution. The theory suggests that competition is the ultimate origin of the uneven income distribution.},

	abstract = {The declining rate of acquiring drivers'licenses by young adults in developed countries has elicited concern among transportation researchers because of the potential consequences for future urban transportation systems. The study uses a dataset collected through a large-scale survey of the students of all four universities in Toronto. The specific aim of the study is to improve understanding of factors affecting the choice of acquiring driver's license by university students in Toronto. Unlike similar studies, it employs econometric approach for the disaggregate analysis using a unique dataset of social-economic, personal, transportation system and land use related variables. Results reveal that the living conditions of university students in the form of living with parents/family show the highest influence in delaying in acquiring drivers'licenses. However, the empirical model also identifies that better transit accessibility plays the second most critical role in delaying the choice of acquiring a driver's license. Public transit pass ownership is proven to be an important mobility tool that discourages the acquiring of drivers'licenses by the students. Students living in densely populated neighborhoods are more likely to delay or do not acquire a driver's license. Students who delay acquiring their driver's license may remain transit-users during their time as students and may also continue to have similar public transit use in future.},

	abstract = {In their authoritative literature review, Breen and Jonsson (2005) claim that `one of the most significant trends in the study of inequalities in educational attainment in the past decade has been the resurgence of rational-choice models focusing on educational decision making'. The starting point of the present contribution is that these models have largely ignored the explanatory relevance of social interactions. To remedy this shortcoming, this paper introduces a micro-founded formal model of the macro-level structure of educational inequality, which frames educational choices as the result of both subjective ability/benefit evaluations and peer-group pressures. As acknowledged by Durlauf (2002, 2006) and Akerlof (1997), however, while the social psychology and ethnographic literature provides abundant empirical evidence of the explanatory relevance of social interactions, statistical evidence on their causal effect is still flawed by identification and selection bias problems. To assess the relative explanatory contribution of the micro-level and network-based mechanisms hypothesised, the paper opts for agent-based computational simulations. In particular, the technique is used to deduce the macro-level consequences of each mechanism (sequentially introduced) and to test these consequences against French aggregate individual-level survey data. The paper's main result is that ability and subjective perceptions of education benefits, no matter how intensely differentiated across agent groups, are not sufficient on their own to generate the actual stratification of educational choices across educational backgrounds existing in France at the beginning of the twenty-first century. By computational counterfactual manipulations, the paper proves that network-based interdependencies among educational choices are instead necessary, and that they contribute, over and above the differentiation of ability and of benefit perceptions, to the genesis of educational stratification by amplifying the segregation of the educational choices that agents make on the basis of purely private ability/benefit calculations.},

Graduated driver licensing (GDL) systems were designed to protect young novice drivers by limiting their exposure to specific risks while they gain experience driving. In the United States, most states'GDL systems only apply to new drivers younger than 18. Some experts suggest that GDL might encourage young people to wait until age 18 to obtain a license, to avoid GDL requirements, resulting in older teenagers having less driving experience and higher crash risk than they might have had without GDL. This study examined the prevalence and timing of licensure among young adults, and explored factors associated with delaying licensure among those not licensed before age 18.},

	abstract = {Pigouvian taxes are efficient --- but unpopular among voters --- and hence often politically infeasible. Earmarking of revenues has been widely reported to increase public support for taxes, but earmarking is generally not the most efficient use of the revenues. This trade-off between efficiency and political feasibility is the motivation for our primary research objective: to quantify the effect of earmarking on support for fuel tax rises. Our secondary research objective is to investigate why earmarking increases support. Using data from a representative sample of the Norwegian voter population (N=1147), we estimate models of voter preferences for fuel taxes using logistic regression models. Our results show that, in the absence of earmarking, the majority of voters would like to reduce fuel taxes, but earmarking the revenues for environmental measures has a substantial effect on voter support for fuel tax increases, garnering a majority for increases of up to 15% above present levels. Further analysis indicates that a prime reason why earmarking for environmental measures is popular is that it increases the perceived environmental effectiveness of the tax, and hence its legitimacy as an environmental rather than a fiscal policy instrument.},

It focuses on literature relating to consumer preferences for charging infrastructure, and how consumers interact with and use this infrastructure. This includes studies that use questionnaire surveys, interviews, modelling, GPS data from vehicles, and data from electric vehicle charging equipment. These studies indicate that the most important location for PEV charging is at home, followed by work, and then public locations. Studies have found that more effort is needed to ensure consumers have easy access to PEV charging and that charging at home, work, or public locations should not be free of cost. Research indicates that PEV charging will not impact electricity grids on the short term, however charging may need to be managed when the vehicles are deployed in greater numbers. In some areas of study the literature is not sufficiently mature to draw any conclusions from. More research is especially needed to determine how much infrastructure is needed to support the roll out of PEVs. This paper ends with policy implications and suggests avenues of future research.},

	abstract = {Aviation emissions are not on a trajectory consistent with Paris Climate Agreement goals. We evaluate the extent to which fuel pathways---synthetic fuels from biomass, synthetic fuels from green hydrogen and atmospheric CO2, and the direct use of green liquid hydrogen---could lead aviation towards net-zero climate impacts. Together with continued efficiency gains and contrail avoidance, but without offsets, such an energy transition could reduce lifecycle aviation CO2 emissions by 89--94\% compared with year-2019 levels, despite a 2--3-fold growth in demand by 2050. The aviation sector could manage the associated cost increases, with ticket prices rising by no more than 15\% compared with a no-intervention baseline leading to demand suppression of less than 14\%. These pathways will require discounted investments on the order of US\$0.5--2.1 trillion over a 30 yr period. However, our pathways reduce aviation CO2-equivalent emissions by only 46--69\%; more action is required to mitigate non-CO2 impacts.},

	abstract = {{The diffusion of new technologies is often mediated by spatial and socioeconomic factors. This article empirically examines the diffusion of an important renewable energy technology: residential solar photovoltaic (PV) systems. Using detailed data on PV installations in Connecticut, we identify the spatial patterns of diffusion, which indicate considerable clustering of adoptions. This clustering does not simply follow the spatial distribution of income or population. We find that smaller centers contribute to adoption more than larger urban areas, in a wave-like centrifugal pattern. Our empirical estimation demonstrates a strong relationship between adoption and the number of nearby previously installed systems as well as built environment and policy variables. The effect of nearby systems diminishes with distance and time, suggesting a spatial neighbor effect conveyed through social interaction and visibility. These results disentangle the process of diffusion of PV systems and provide guidance to stakeholders in the solar market.}},

	abstract = {In the course of its transition of the energy sector Germany aims to provide 80 per cent of the power supply from renewable energy sources. Although it is projected that wind power will be the main contributor in the energy transition, due to its spatial implications it is targeted by considerable local opposition, thus jeopardising the success of many wind energy projects. Previous research has found that distributive and procedural justice issues are common factors influencing local public acceptance. This paper explores local public preferences for different forms of financial and procedural participation by means of choice experiments and focus groups. The results show that wind power projects are generally accepted by the local public if certain condition, i.e. shareholding and high levels of participation in the decision-making process are offered. Policy recommendations are given on how wind power projects should be implemented so as to counteract local opposition. Deepening the understanding of these issues is of practical importance for future wind energy development.},

	n2 = {Discrete choice modeling is a fundamental part of travel demand forecasting. To date, this field has been dominated by parametric approaches (e.g., logit models), but non-parametric approaches such as artificial neural networks (ANNs) possess much potential since choice problems can be assimilated to pattern recognition problems. In particular, ANN models are easily applicable with their higher capability to identify nonlinear relationships between inputs and designated outputs to predict choice behaviors. This article investigates the capability of four types of ANN model and compares their prediction performance with a conventional multinomial logit model (MNL) for mode choice problems. The four ANNs are: backpropagation neural networks (BPNNs), radial basis function networks (RBFNs), probabilistic neural networks (PNNs), and clustered probabilistic neural networks (CPNNs). To compare the modeling techniques, we present the algorithmic differences of each ANN technique, and we assess their prediction accuracy with a 10-fold cross-validation method. Furthermore, we assess the contribution of explanatory variables by conducting sensitivity analyses on significant variables. The results show that ANN models outperform MNL, with prediction accuracies around 80{\%} compared with 70{\%} for MNL. Moreover, PNN performs best out of all ANNs, especially to predict underrepresented modes.},

	abstract = {Conventional methods of estimating latent behaviour generally use attitudinal questions which are subjective and these survey questions may not always be available. We hypothesize that an alternative approach such as non-parametric artificial neural networks can be used for latent variable estimation through an undirected graphical models. In this study, we explore the use of generative non-parametric modelling methods to estimate latent variables from prior choice distribution without the conventional use of measurement indicators. A restricted Boltzmann machine is used to represent latent behaviour factors by analyzing the relationship information between the observed choices and explanatory variables. The algorithm is adapted for latent behaviour analysis in discrete choice scenario and we use a graphical approach to evaluate and understand the semantic meaning from estimated parameter vector values. We illustrate our methodology on a financial instrument choice dataset and perform statistical analysis on parameter sensitivity and stability. Our findings show that through non-parametric statistical tests, we can extract useful latent information on the behaviour of latent constructs through machine learning methods and present strong and significant influence on the choice process. Furthermore, our modelling framework shows robustness in input variability through sampling and validation.},

@article{Salak:2021aa,
	abstract = {We present stated preference data based on a national representative Swiss online panel survey related to preference of mixed renewable energy infrastructure in landscapes. Data were collected between November 2018 and March 2019 via an online questionnaire and yielded 1026 responses. The online questionnaire consisted of two main parts --(1) questions covering meanings related to landscapes, nature and renewable energy infrastructure and questions regarding the ``fit''of landscape/renewable energy infrastructure (REI) combinations and (2) a stated choice experiment. While in the first part of the questionnaire we asked respondents about their personal connection to certain landscapes, to nature and to specific REI, we also asked them to evaluate the fitting of seven different Swiss landscapes (near natural alpine areas, northern alps, touristic alpine areas, agricultural plateau, urban plateau, Jura ridges, urban alpine valley) with five different REI (wind, PV ground/agricultural, PV ground/other, PV roof, power lines) combinations. In the second part of the questionnaire, the stated choice experiment confronted respondents with 15 consecutive choice tasks, with each task involving a choice between two ``energy system transformation''options and an opt-out option (none). Each choice option (beside the opt-out option) included four unlabeled attributes (landscape, wind energy infrastructure, photovoltaic energy infrastructure, high voltage overhead power line infrastructure) with varying levels. Due to data cleaning procedures (item nonresponse) the number of responses used within hybrid choice modeling and analysis was n = 844 (12,660 choice observations). An analysis of the hybrid choice model and further insights are presented in the article ``How landscape-technology fit affects public evaluations of renewable energy infrastructure scenarios. A hybrid choice model.''},

@article{Roorda:2008aa,
	abstract = {The objective of this paper is to verify/validate the results of an application of the Travel Activity Scheduler for Household Agents (TASHA) in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), Canada. Activity generation and scheduling components of TASHA are validated using 1996 and 2001 travel survey data for the GTA. This validation proceeds in two parts: (a) verification that TASHA replicates the 1996 base case upon which the model was originally built; and (b) comparison of TASHA's forecasts of 2001 daily travel behaviour with observed travel survey data for 2001. TASHA activity generation and scheduling model components replicate observed activities with good accuracy and precision for the base year. Although TASHA is not able to predict an observed increase in activity participation rate in a five year forecast, the distribution of activities in the day is forecast with greater success. Predictions of average travel distance are oversimulated in the base year by 0.9{\%}. Increased average distances are underpredicted for school, shopping, and other activities, and are overpredicted for work and return home activities. These validation results are promising, although there exist opportunities to improve model performance, and to further validate other elements of the TASHA model.},

@article{Astroza:2018aa,
	abstract = {This paper is motivated by the increasing recognition that modeling activity-travel demand for a single day of the week, as is done in virtually all travel forecasting models, may be inadequate in capturing underlying processes that govern activity-travel scheduling behavior. The considerable variability in daily travel suggests that there are important complementary relationships and competing tradeoffs involved in scheduling and allocating time to various activities across days of the week. Both limited survey data availability and methodological challenges in modeling week-long activity-travel schedules have precluded the development of multi-day activity-travel demand models. With passive and technology-based data collection methods increasingly in vogue, the collection of multi-day travel data may become increasingly commonplace in the years ahead. This paper addresses the methodological challenge associated with modeling multi-day activity-travel demand by formulating a multivariate multiple discrete-continuous probit (MDCP) model system. The comprehensive framework ties together two MDCP model components, one corresponding to weekday time allocation and the other to weekend activity-time allocation. By tying the two MDCP components together, the model system also captures relationships in activity-time allocation between weekdays on the one hand and weekend days on the other. Model estimation on a week-long travel diary data set from the United Kingdom shows that there are significant inter-relationships between weekdays and weekend days in activity-travel scheduling behavior. The model system presented in this paper may serve as a higher-level multi-day activity scheduler in conjunction with existing daily activity-based travel models.},

	abstract = {This article presents the MOBIS dataset and underlying survey methods used in its collection. The MOBIS study was a nation-wide randomised controlled trial (RCT) of transport pricing in Switzerland, utilising a combination of postal recruitment, online surveys, and GPS tracking. 21,571 persons completed the first online survey, and 3680 persons completed 8 weeks of GPS tracking. Many continued tracking for over a year after the study was completed. In the field experiment, participants participated through the use of a GPS tracking app, Catch-my-Day, which logged their daily travel on different transport modes and imputed the trip segments and modes. The experiment lasted 8 weeks, bookended by two online surveys. After the first 4-week control phase, participants were split into two different treatment groups and a continued control group. An analysis of the survey participation shows that the technology is capable of supporting such an experiment on both Android and iOS, the two main mobile platforms. Significant differences in the engagement and attrition were observed between iOS and Android participants over the 8-week period. Finally, the attrition rate did not vary between treatment groups. This paper also reports on the wealth of data that are being made available for further research, which includes over 3 million trip stages and activities, labelled with transport mode and purpose respectively.},

The prior information of the rationally inattentive agent is summarized in a constant vector of utilities in the corresponding ARUM.},

@inproceedings{Miller:2020aa,
	abstract = {This chapter discusses the need for the next generation of travel demand models. Tracing the origins of the IATBR from its first conference, many advances in travel demand modeling have occurred, notably the widespread adoption of random utility-based modeling methods, increasing implementation of activity-based (or, more typically, tour-based) models, and acceptance of microsimulation (in many quarters at least) as a practical computational approach for dealing with disaggregate, heterogeneous trip-makers. We are now in an era where the transportation field is being disrupted in ways that have not been experienced during the past 100 years. Not only are these disruptions fundamentally changing our transportation systems, but they are also posing new and very difficult challenges to even the best of our current travel demand models. Indeed, the basic premise of this chapter is that our current models are inadequate to analyze this ``brave new world''of new technologies and services. The policy needed to be able to model and evaluate these disruptions, however, is great. Thus, it is urgently required to develop and test new travel demand models that are capable of credibly dealing with this emerging new world and to help guide policies that will ensure that these coming changes will, in fact, result in more equitable and sustainable urban regions, rather than the reverse. Section 2 of this chapter briefly discusses a few of these key disruptions and some of the challenges that they pose to the current travel demand modeling state of practice/art. To frame the discussion of travel demand modeling R\&D needs to address these challenges, Section 3 defines the ``four pillars''of modeling. Based on these four pillars, four ``provocations''concerning modeling challenges and needs are introduced that are then discussed in detail in Sections 4--7, respectively. Section 8, concludes the chapter by summarizing the preceding discussions in terms of recommendations concerning key steps that need to be taken toward development of a next generation of advanced travel demand models. Taking these steps will, indeed, require bold actions that, if successful, will take us into new policy analysis and modeling territories.},

Nowadays, a variety of toolkits and frameworks exists providing functionalities for supporting implementation and execution of simulation experiments. Yet, the choice of a suitable framework is difficult as unforeseen scalability issues may arise when extending agent models. Therefore, this paper aims at providing a method for analyzing and comparing agent-based simulation frameworks regarding their ability to scale simulation models and experiments.

TimeUse+ is a novel tool that collects GPS tracks passively and has users actively enrich tracked events with activity and expenditure information all within the same diary app. We document all components of our flexible platform in their entirety before evaluating the data collection tool in two applications with over 200 individuals in Switzerland. We test several configurations that alter study duration, detail of activities performed, and the monetary incentive offered. Results suggest that it is reasonable to apply our framework for an extended period of four weeks, yielding rich longitudinal accounts of individuals' travel, time use, and expenditure patterns.

	abstract = {Outdoor air pollution was responsible for approximately 4.2 million deaths around the world in 2016, with the emissions from road vehicles being the main source of air pollution in urban areas. To fulfill the need to identify the contribution of pollutants emitted by on-road vehicles and examine the limitations of various air quality models (boundary conditions, wind behavior representations, chemical mechanisms and reactions), a systematic review of the main traffic variables used in emissions and air quality modeling was performed. The discussion of their relationships, connections, and relevance showed a consistent sequence to generate traffic data using different traffic models. A list of key traffic variables to use as input data for vehicle emissions modeling and consequently to improve the accuracy of air quality modeling was proposed. A revision over 125 published articles was realized approaching methods to integrate traffic, emissions, air quality models, and detailing how these data can improve the results generated by the air quality model. Traffic models (macroscopic, mesoscopic, and microscopic) require variables at different levels of detail, such as traffic flow, speed, fuel consumption, and fleet composition. The emissions models (static and dynamic) are the key inputs to regional air quality models, but there is a tradeoff between the accuracy in emission estimates and the level of detail in model inputs. Meteorological data also influence the results. The conclusions showed that gaps remain on consistent emissions factors, spatial and temporal distributions, allocations of emissions on grid cells, and performance of the meteorological models. The average link-based traffic parameters are a persistent limitation. The proposed key traffic variables list point to flow per vehicle type as the most important variable. There is a need for scientific efforts to integrate traffic engineering data into emissions models to improve air quality modeling results using better traffic flow representations. Uncertainties in traffic data must first be analyzed, and accordingly a guidance with an accuracy reference for distinctive applications in different regions should be proposed.},

DynaMIT is a real-time system that can be used to generate guidance for travelers. The main principle on which DynaMIT is based is that information should be consistent, and user optimal. Consistency implies that the traffic conditions experienced by the travelers are consistent with the condition assumed in generating the guidance. To generate consistent user optimal information, DynaMIT performs two main functions: state estimation and prediction. A demand simulator and a supply simulator interact to perform these tasks. A case study demonstrates the value of the system.},

The simulator is integrated because its models, inputs and outputs, simulated components, and code base are integrated within a multiscale agent- and activity-based simulation platform capable of simulating different spatiotemporal resolutions and accounting for different levels of travelers? decision making. The simulator is microscopic because both the demand (agents and its trips) and the supply (trip realization and movements on the network) are microscopic (i.e., modeled individually). Finally, the simulator has mobility because it copes with the multimodal nature of urban networks and the need for the flexible simulation of innovative transportation services, such as on-demand and smart mobility solutions. This paper follows previous publications that describe SimMobility?s overall framework and models. SimMobility is an open-source, multiscale platform that considers land use, transportation, and mobility-sensitive behavioral models. SimMobility ST aims at simulating the high-resolution movement of agents (traffic, transit, pedestrians, and goods) and the operation of different mobility services and control and information systems. This paper presents the SimMobility ST modeling framework and system architecture and reports on its successful calibration for Singapore and its use in several scenarios of innovative mobility applications. The paper also shows how detailed performance measures from SimMobility ST can be integrated with a daily activity and mobility patterns simulator. Such integration is crucial to model accurately the effect of different technologies and service operations at the urban level, as the identity and preferences of simulated agents are maintained across temporal decision scales, ensuring the consistency and accuracy of simulated accessibility and performance measures of each scenario.},

	abstract = {Scenarios provide a commonly used and intuitively appealing means to communicate and characterize uncertainty in many decision support applications, but can fall short of their potential especially when used in broad public debates among participants with diverse interests and values. This paper describes a new approach to participatory, computer-assisted scenario development that we call scenario discovery, which aims to address these challenges. The approach defines scenarios as a set of plausible future states of the world that represent vulnerabilities of proposed policies, that is, cases where a policy fails to meet its performance goals. Scenario discovery characterizes such sets by helping users to apply statistical or data-mining algorithms to databases of simulation-model-generated results in order to identify easy-to-interpret combinations of uncertain model input parameters that are highly predictive of these policy-relevant cases. The approach has already proved successful in several high impact policy studies. This paper systematically describes the scenario discovery concept and its implementation, presents statistical tests to evaluate the resulting scenarios, and demonstrates the approach on an example policy problem involving the efficacy of a proposed U.S. renewable energy standard. The paper also describes how scenario discovery appears to address several outstanding challenges faced when applying traditional scenario approaches in contentious public debates.},

For model runs with behavior over time, these properties are identified by reducing each run to a single value, which obscures potentially decision-relevant dynamics. We address the problem of considering dynamics in Scenario Discovery by applying time series clustering to the ensemble of model runs, and then finding the common input properties for each cluster. This separates the input space into multiple scenarios, each corresponding to a distinct model dynamic. Policy interventions can be targeted at different scenarios by analyzing overlap of these subspaces. Our work expands Scenario Discovery by improving consideration of system behavior over time, which is highly relevant for the management of complex nonlinear systems such as ecosystems or technical infrastructure.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we attempt to derive and test the role of energy prices on economic growth. We first developed a two-sector endogenous growth model, based on J Polit Economy 1991; 99:500--521. We modified the model such that consumption goods sector uses energy as an input along with capital. The model allows us to show that the growth rate of energy price has a negative effect on the growth rates of energy use and real GDP. Following this, derived theoretical relationships between energy prices and economic growth and energy consumption were tested empirically using error-correction based panel cointegration tests and panel Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) approach. We applied this methodology on data of composite energy prices, GDP per capita and energy consumption per capita for sixteen countries for the period between 1978 and 2011. We found significant cointegration between energy prices and real GDP per capita, as well as between energy prices and energy consumption per capita. Moreover, long-run estimates reveal negative and significant effects of composite energy prices on both GDP per capita and energy consumption per capita. We suggest that increasing the share of renewable energy sources in energy consumption would help policy-makers to control permanent long-term increases in consumer energy prices, in turn leading to an increase in economic growth, and hence in welfare. This paper contributes to the literature by highlighting the existence of a previously neglected welfare-improving channel of renewable energy.},

We argue that to meet climate change mitigation targets, psychologists need to look beyond the behaviors they have typically studied---frequent curtailment behaviors that are easy to measure---and focus on actions that have a greater impact over the long term. To guide these efforts, we present a conceptual framework that classifies individual and household behaviors by their potential to reasonably achieve emissions reductions. We then review available evidence regarding the determinants of those behaviors, identify gaps in research efforts to date, and conclude by pointing to more productive research directions for psychologists working in this area.},

We introduce a value-based approach, which entails that different characteristics of energy projects may violate or support people's core values, which evokes emotions in people. We present a theoretical framework of the relationship between people's values, the (perceived) implications of energy projects for these values, and people's emotional responses to energy projects. We give examples from case studies in the literature to substantiate our reasoning, and we offer directions for future research.

@article{Liu:2020aa,
	abstract = {Acceptability of renewable energy projects depends on the trust people have in agents responsible for those projects. Two dimensions of trust are relevant in this respect: competence-based and integrity-based trust. Yet, the unique and interaction effects of these two dimensions of trust on project acceptability are not well understood. We conducted two experimental studies to test these effects in China and the Netherlands. As expected, higher integrity-based trust in responsible agents led to higher project acceptability in both countries. Notably, these effects were independent of the level of competence-based trust. Competence-based trust enhanced project acceptability only in China and only when integrity-based trust was low. Mediation analyses further showed that (part of) the effects of both dimensions of trust on project acceptability could be explained by people's perceptions of how the decisions were made, in both countries. Results suggest that integrity-based trust has a more profound effect on project acceptability.},

@article{Zawadzki:2020aa,
	abstract = {While it is often suggested that individuals'pro-environmental behaviors may be linked with their subjective wellbeing, the strength and direction (e.g. positive or negative) of this relation is unclear. Because pro-environmental behaviors impact peoples'everyday lives, understanding this relation is critical for promoting long-term environmental solutions. Using a series of meta-analyses, we systematically reviewed the literature on the association between individuals'pro-environmental behaviors and their subjective wellbeing. We hypothesized that the relation between pro-environmental behavior and subjective wellbeing would be positive and strongest among types of behaviors (e.g. sustainable purchase decisions) and indicators of subjective wellbeing which more clearly reflect personal meaning (e.g. warm glow). We sourced studies via PsychINFO, PsychARTICLES, GreenFile, SocINDEX, Web of Science, and Scopus, as well as professional email lists, direct contact with authors who publish in this domain, data from the authorship team, and the European Social Survey (2016). We included studies with quantitative data on the relation between individuals'pro-environmental behavior and their subjective wellbeing, ultimately identifying 78 studies (73 published, 5 unpublished) for synthesis. Across multiple indicators of pro-environmental behaviors and subjective wellbeing, we found a significant, positive relation (overall r = .243), and this relation did not meaningfully differ across study characteristics (e.g. sample, design). As predicted, the relation was particularly strong for indicators of pro-environmental behavior and subjective wellbeing which clearly reflect meaning, such as sustainable purchase decisions (r = .291) and for warm glow (r = .408). We found a robust, positive relation between people's pro-environmental behaviors and subjective wellbeing, and initial evidence that this relation may be stronger the more clearly behaviors and indicators of subjective wellbeing reflect meaning. Our results indicate that program and policy-makers can seek opportunities to design `win-win'sustainability programs which could positively impact both people and the environment.},

Theory suggests that three values---self-interest, altruism toward other humans, and altruism toward other species and the biosphere---will influence decision-making. These three values have been reliably measured in survey instruments around the world. Most studies support the theoretical expectation that altruism, and especially altruism toward other species and the biosphere, influence environmentally consequential decisions, but that influence is often indirect through identity, beliefs, and norms. Overall, research on environmental values has produced well-developed theory, reliable and flexible measurement strategies, and a substantial body of empirical results confirming the influence of values on environmental decisions.},

We show that these options, bridging socio-behavioural, infrastructural and technological domains, can reduce counterfactual sectoral emissions by 40--80{\%} in end-use sectors. Based on expert judgement and an extensive literature database, we evaluate 306 combinations of well-being outcomes and demand-side options, finding largely beneficial effects in improvement in well-being (79{\%} positive, 18{\%} neutral and 3{\%} negative), even though we find low confidence on the social dimensions of well-being. Implementing such nuanced solutions is based axiomatically on an understanding of malleable rather than fixed preferences, and procedurally on changing infrastructures and choice architectures. Results demonstrate the high mitigation potential of demand-side mitigation options that are synergistic with well-being.},

@article{Abrahamse:2005aa,
	abstract = {This article reviews and evaluates the effectiveness of interventions aiming to encourage households to reduce energy consumption. Thirty-eight studies performed within the field of (applied) social and environmental psychology are reviewed, and categorized as involving either antecedent strategies (i.e. commitment, goal setting, information, modeling) or consequence strategies (i.e. feedback, rewards). Particular attention is given to the following evaluation criteria: (1) to what extent did the intervention result in behavioral changes and/or reductions in energy use, (2) were underlying behavioral determinants examined (e.g. knowledge, attitudes), (3) to what extent could effects be attributed to the interventions and, (4) were effects maintained over longer periods of time? Interestingly, most studies focus on voluntary behavior change, by changing individual knowledge and/or perceptions rather than changing contextual factors (i.e. pay-off structure) which may determine households'behavioral decisions. Interventions have been employed with varying degrees of success. Information tends to result in higher knowledge levels, but not necessarily in behavioral changes or energy savings. Rewards have effectively encouraged energy conservation, but with rather short-lived effects. Feedback has also proven its merits, in particular when given frequently. Some important issues cloud these conclusions, such as methodological problems. Also, little attention is given to actual environmental impact of energy savings. Often, an intervention's effectiveness is studied without examining underlying psychological determinants of energy use and energy savings. Also, it is not always clear whether effects were maintained over a longer period of time. Recommendations are given to further improve intervention planning and to enhance the effectiveness of interventions.},

@article{WangYe24,
	abstract = { This paper further explores multiple discrete-continuous extreme value (MDCEV) models. MDCEV models are widely used for time-use analysis because they can accommodate the diminishing marginal utility with respect to time consumption and benefit from simple closed-form likelihood expressions for estimation, while considering the overall constraints of time resource. However, all of the existing models adopt a monotonically increasing form of utility function, which does not accommodate possible non-monotonic utilities with respect to time-use. This paper further develops the MDCEV model by firstly introducing utility functions with a form of parabola to capture non-monotonic preferences in time allocation behaviors. A corresponding simple and computationally efficient forecasting algorithm to predict the time-use of individuals is also developed. The proposed MDCEV model with parabolic utilities is applied to analyze time-use decisions among a variety of outdoor non-mandatory activities on weekends using data from the 2019 American Time Use Survey. The proposed model is compared with traditional MDCEV models to show its ability to describe non-monotonic preferences in time-use in association with various explanatory variables. This paper makes an initial attempt to specify non-monotonic utilities for time-use analysis, but further studies are required to develop more sophisticated non-monotonic utility formulation to improve the goodness-of-fit of the model. },

The algorithms build on simple yet insightful, analytical explorations with the Karush Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of optimality that shed new light on the properties of the models. The MDCEV model and the forecasting algorithms proposed in this paper are applied to a household-level energy consumption dataset to analyze residential energy consumption patterns in the United States. Further, simulation experiments are undertaken to assess the computational performance of the proposed and existing KT demand forecasting algorithms for a range of choice situations with small and large choice sets.},

AMoD provides a service similar to taxi or ride-sharing services, while being driverless. It is expected to attract a huge fraction of travelers currently using mass transit or private vehicles and will have a disruptive effect on urban transportation. While most studies have focused on the operational efficiency of the technology itself, our work aims to investigate its impact on urban mobility. Our contribution is two-fold. First, we present a flexible AMoD modeling and simulation framework developed within a multi-modal agent-based urban simulation platform (SimMobility). The framework allows the detailed simulation and assessment of different AMoD operations together with an activity-based framework that accounts for changes in demand, such as activity participation, trip making, mode, destination, or route choice decisions. Second, we focus our attention on the role of mass transit in a futuristic urban system where AMoD is widely available. Mass transit is already challenged by current ride-sharing services, for example, Uber and Lyft, which provide comparatively better and cheaper services. This trend will plausibly be exacerbated with the introduction of AMoD, which may indirectly act as a replacement to mass transit. Our simulation results show that mass transit is irreplaceable, despite the high efficiency of AMoD, in order to avoid congestion and maintain a sustainable urban transportation system with acceptable levels of service.},

	abstract = {Assessing and predicting car type choices are important for policy analysis. Car type choice models are often based on aggregate alternatives. This is due to the fact that analysts typically do not observe choices at the detailed level that they are made. In this paper, we use registry data of all new car purchases in Sweden for two years where cars are observed by their brand, model and fuel type. However, the choices are made at a more detailed level. Hence, an aggregate (observed) alternative can correspond to several disaggregate (detailed) alternatives. We present an extensive empirical study analyzing estimation results, in-sample and out-of-sample fit as well as prediction performance of five model specifications. These models use different aggregation methods from the literature. We propose a specification of a two-level nested logit model that captures correlation between aggregate and disaggregate alternatives. The nest specific scale parameters are defined as parameterized exponential functions to keep the number of parameters reasonable. The results show that the in-sample and out-of-sample fit as well as the prediction performance differ. The best model accounts for the heterogeneity over disaggregate alternatives as well as the correlation between both disaggregate and aggregate alternatives. It outperforms the commonly used aggregation method of simply including a size measure.},

@article{SaisGarl87,
	abstract = { Sequential spatial choices of shopping destinations in the largescale environment, entailed by multistop trip planning, have been modeled as a sequence of choices of closest locations. The validity of such modeling attempts was questioned by the results of a reported study. In a laboratory test, subjects who solved simulated trip-planning problems with one, two, or three choice sets with pairs of familiar locations were found frequently to choose in a way that total distance was minimized even though this meant that the closest location was not chosen each time. The results were similar in a field test in which subjects were taken to a downtown business district, asked to choose locations, and to walk to the chosen locations. Subjects were furthermore found to make few revisions when implementing their choices. The ability to minimize total distance probably relied on the discovery of spatial configurations of locations that appeared to presuppose a simultaneous representation of the locations, as suggested by differences in results in both the laboratory and the field tests depending on whether subjects had access to a street map or not, in the laboratory test depending on whether the locations were downtown or all over the city. },

Our primary goal is to present a framework which enables one to obtain estimates of demand and cost parameters for a class of oligopolistic differentiated products markets. These estimates can be obtained using only widely available product-level and aggregate consumer-level data, and they are consistent with a structural model of equilibrium in an oligopolistic industry. When we apply the techniques developed here to the U.S. automobile market, we obtain cost and demand parameters for (essentially) all models marketed over a twenty year period.},

	abstract = {Several consumer demand choices are characterized by the choice of multiple alternatives simultaneously. An example of such a choice situation in activity-travel analysis is the type of discretionary (or leisure) activity to participate in and the duration of time investment of the participation. In this context, within a given temporal period (say a day or a week), an individual may decide to participate in multiple types of activities (for example, in-home social activities, out-of-home social activities, in-home recreational activities, out-of-home recreational activities, and out-of-home non-maintenance shopping activities). In this paper, we derive and formulate a utility theory-based model for discrete/continuous choice that assumes diminishing marginal utility as the level of consumption of any particular alternative increases (i.e., satiation). This assumption yields a multiple discreteness model (i.e., choice of multiple alternatives can occur simultaneously). This is in contrast to the standard discrete choice model that is based on assuming the absence of any diminishing marginal utility as the level of consumption of any alternative increases (i.e., no satiation), leading to the case of strictly single discreteness. The econometric model formulated here, which we refer to as the multiple discrete-continuous extreme value (MDCEV) model, has a surprisingly simple and elegant closed form expression for the discrete-continuous probability of not consuming certain alternatives and consuming given levels of the remaining alternatives. To our knowledge, we are the first to develop such a simple and powerful closed-form model for multiple discreteness in the literature. This formulation should constitute an important milestone in the area of multiple discreteness, just as the multinomial logit (MNL) represented an important milestone in the area of single discreteness. Further, the MDCEV model formulated here has the appealing property that it collapses to the familiar multinomial logit (MNL) choice model in the case of single discreteness. Finally, heteroscedasticity and/or correlation in unobserved characteristics affecting the demand of different alternatives can be easily incorporated within the MDCEV model framework using a mixing approach. The MDCEV model and its mixed variant are applied to analyze time-use allocation decisions among a variety of discretionary activities on weekends using data from the 2000 San Francisco Bay Area survey. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Random utility models are typically based on the assumptions that individuals exhibit compensatory behaviour and that their choice sets are pre-specified. These assumptions may be unrealistic in many practical cases; in particular, it has been argued that thresholds may be part of choice--rejection mechanisms (i.e. if the threshold of any attribute for a given alternative is surpassed the alternative is rejected) and, therefore, act as explicit criteria to determine the set of feasible alternatives. We formulate a semi-compensatory two-stage discrete choice model incorporating randomly distributed thresholds for attribute acceptance. The formulation allows us to estimate the parameters of the threshold's probability distribution; these parameters can be expressed as a function of the socio-economics characteristics of the individual and the conditions under which the choice process takes place. Applying the model to real and simulated data allowed us to conclude that if thresholds exist in the population, the use of compensatory models such as Multinomial Logit or even Mixed Logit, can lead to serious errors in model estimation and, therefore, in the computation of marginal rates of substitution such as the subjective value of time, as well as in prediction. Although the Mixed Logit model can deal with random parameters allowing to treat taste differences, we found it could not be used to accommodate non-compensatory behaviour or to represent the existence of thresholds.},

@article{Cascetta:2001aa,
	abstract = {Random utility models are undoubtedly the most used models for the simulation of transport demand. These models simulate the choice of a decision-maker among a set of feasible alternatives and their operational use requires that the analyst is able to correctly specify this choice-set for each individual. Some early applications basically ignored this problem by assuming that all decision-makers chose from the same pre-specified choice-set. This assumption may be unrealistic in many practical cases and cause significant misspecification problems (P. Stopher, Transportation Journal of ASCE 106 (1980) 427; H. Williams, J. Ortuzar, Transportation Research B 16 (1982) 167). The problem of choice-set simulation has been dealt within the literature following two basically different approaches:*simulating the perception/availability of an alternative implicitly in the choice model,*simulating the choice-set generation explicitly in a separate model. The implicit approach is more convenient from an operational point of view, while the explicit one is more appealing from a theoretical point of view. In this paper, a different approach to the modeling of availability/perception of alternatives in the context of random utility model is proposed. This approach is based on the concept of intermediate degrees of availability/perception of each alternative simulated through a model (or ``inclusion function'') which in turn is introduced in the systematic utility of standard random utility models. This model, named implicit availability/perception (IAP), may be differently specified depending on assumptions made on the joint distribution of random residuals and the way in which the average degree of availability/perception is modeled. In this paper, a possible specification of the IAP model, based on the assumption of random residual distributed as i.i. Gumbel and with the average degree of availability/perception modeled as a binomial logit, is proposed. The paper also proposes ML estimation models in two cases: in the first, only information on alternatives choices is available, while in the second, this information is complemented with others on variables related to a latent (i.e., non-observable) alternatives availability/perception degree (e.g., information on car availability of decision-maker i used as an indirect measurement of the unknown and non-observable availability/perception degree of alternative car for decision-maker i in a modal split). The proposed specification is tested on mode choice data; the calibration results are compared with those of a similar logit specification with encouraging results in terms of goodness of fit.},

	abstract = {Discrete choice models are based on the idea that each user can choose both freely and independently from other users in a given set of alternatives. But this is not the case in several situations. In particular, limitations and interactions can occur when the number of available products of one type is smaller than the total demand for this type. As a consequence, some individuals can be denied their preferred choice. We develop a methodology to address those constraints and we apply it to residential location choice, where our empirical data suggest that availability constraints may bias actual choices. The analysis provides some theoretical developments and elaborates an iterative procedure for estimating demand in the presence of capacity constraints. The empirical application relies on the location choice model developed and estimated in [A. de Palma, K. Motamedi, N. Picard, P. Waddell, A model of residential location choice with endogenous housing prices and traffic for the Paris region, European Transport, 2006] for Ile-de-France (Paris region) and generalizes it to integrate capacity constraints.},

	abstract = {Consideration set formation (CSF) is a two-stage decision process in which people first select a subset of products to consider and then evaluate and choose from the selected subset of products. CSF models typically use stated consideration or infer it from choice data probabilistically. This study explores CSF by means of eye-tracking and evaluates how measures of visual consideration compare to stated consideration. We develop a model of CSF behavior, where stated and visual consideration are embedded in the specification of the utility function. We propose three different measures of visual consideration and show that one third of respondents (∼34{\%}) use CSF behavior and that stated consideration diverges substantially from visual consideration. Surprisingly, many product types stated as not considered receive more visual attention, not less. Our findings suggest that stated consideration may be in part a measure of preferences rather than of consideration, implying concerns with endogeneity when including stated consideration data in choice models. Accounting for CSF in discrete choice analysis increases our understanding of the decision process, and can target concerns with biased estimates when analyzing data from two-stage decision processes.},

Three choice set generation methods for route choice were examined in their ability to generate relevant and heterogeneous routes: doubly stochastic generation function, breadth first search on link elimination, and branch \&amp; bound algorithm. Efficiency of the methods was evaluated for a high-resolution network by comparing the performances with four multiattribute cost functions accounting for scenic routes, dedicated cycle lanes, and road type. Data consisted of 778 bicycle trips traced by GPS and carried out by 139 persons living in the Greater Copenhagen Area, in Denmark. Results suggest that both the breadth first search on link elimination and the doubly stochastic generation function generated realistic routes, while the former outperformed in computation cost and the latter produced more heterogeneous routes.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

	abstract = {The traditional formulation of logit models applied to transport demand assumes a compensatory (indirect) utility function in which the consumers' strategy assumes a trade-off between attributes. Several authors have criticized this approach because it fails to recognize attribute thresholds in consumer behavior, or a more generic domain where such a compensatory strategy is contained. In this paper, a mixed strategy is proposed, which combines the compensatory strategy valid in the interior of the choice domain with cutoff factors that restrain choices to the domain edge. The proposed model combines the multinomial logit model with a binomial logit factor that represents soft cutoffs. This approach extends previous contributions in several ways and allows multiple dimensions for cutoff factors. In addition to considering individual behavior, it introduces system constraints such as capacity and inter-agent interactions (choice externalities). This extension yields a non-linear problem, which is solved by analyzing the fixed point problem. Additionally, a set of evaluation tools, a social utility of the constrained problem, and a measure of the shadow price of each constraint, are proposed.},

	abstract = {The so-called activity-based approach to analysis of human interaction with the social and physical environments dates back to the original time--space geography works of H{\"a}gerstrand and his colleagues at the Lund School. Despite their obvious theoretical attractiveness, activity-based approaches to understanding and predicting travel behavior have suffered from the absence of an analytical framework that unifies the complex interactions among the resource allocation decisions made by households in conducting their daily affairs outside the home, while preserving the utility-maximizing principles presumed to guide such decisions. In this paper, we develop a computationally tractable system, based on an extension and modification of some rather well-known network-based formulations in operations research, to model human dynamics in uncertain environments. The research builds on the mixed integer linear program formulation of the Household Activity Pattern Problem (HAPP) by embedding in the household activity schedule decision process a means of capturing uncertainty by introducing the dynamics of rescheduling.},

@article{Tsoleridis:2023aa,
	abstract = {Understanding the constraints that individuals face during their spatial choices is important from a policy perspective. Such constraints, however, are often overlooked in the choice set generation process during model development. In order to address that gap, the current study proposes a probabilistic choice set formation based on Manski's framework assuming that the actual choice set of an individual is latent (unobserved). Though latent class models with heterogeneous choice sets have been used previously in the context of mode and route choice, their application in the context of spatial choices have been hindered due to the inherently large choice sets making the problem computationally intractable. To address this issue, we propose to computationally simplify the problem by utilising the geography-derived notions of Activity Spaces to delineate a range of potential choice sets per individual helping us to capture both issues of spatial awareness and time-space constraints. In order to account for the latent nature of the true choice set, we propose a Latent Class Choice Modelling (LCCM) framework to allocate the individuals probabilistically into the different resulting choice sets, with each class having a different choice set and a different set of parameters. Thus the LCCM is able to capture heterogeneity in the choice sets and in the sensitivities, at the same time. The proposed LCCM framework is empirically tested on joint mode and shopping destination choices captured through a GPS smartphone application. It is compared to a base MNL model estimated on the global choice set, an LCCM capturing heterogeneity only in the sensitivities and a LCCM with latent consideration choice sets, similarly to the proposed model, but with generic parameters across classes. Our proposed specification is able to outperform all of the remaining models, while also providing insights on the factors affecting individuals to be constrained in their location choices across space hinting to cases of spatial cognition, the importance of the home and workplace geography and the individual's socioeconomic status. Such insights can be important for developing more behaviourally realistic models that can be used by planners and policy makers to formulate more effective measures that better relate to the underlying population. Furthermore, the analysis provides insights into the discrepancies that can emerge by accounting for latent consideration sets in willingness-to-pay measures and demand elasticities, which could have significant implications in the effectiveness of policy measures.},

@article{Adler1979,
	abstract = {This paper addresses the theoretical and empirical issues involved in modeling complex travel patterns. Existing models have the shortcoming of not representing the interdependencies among trip links in trip chains with multiple non-home stops. A theoretical model based on utility theory and explicitly accounting for the trade-offs involved in the choice of multiple-stop chains is developed. Using this theoretical model, utility maximizing conditions for a household's choice of a daily travel pattern are derived. The optimum travel pattern is described in terms of the number of chairs (tours) traveled on a given day and in terms of the number of stops (sojourns) made on each of those chains. For a given household, the form of the optimum pattern is a function of the transportation expenditures (time, cost) required to reach potential destinations. Constraints on the conditions of optimality due to the limited and discrete nature of travel pattern alternatives are also considered. Parameters of the general utility function were estimated empirically using actual travel data derived from a home interview survey taken in Washington, D.C. The multinomial logit model is used to relate utility scores for the alternative travel patterns to choice probabilities. The resulting parameter estimates agree with theoretical expectations and with empirical results obtained in other studies. In order to demonstrate the empirical and theoretical implications of the model, forecasts for various transportation policies (e.g., gasoline price increases, transit fare reductions), as made by this model and by other less complex models, are compared. The results of these comparisons indicate the need for expanding the scope of existing travel forecasting models to explicit considerations of trip chaining behavior.},

@article{Allahviranloo2018,
	abstract = {The choice of `dining out with friends' or `wrapping up unfinished tasks at work' depends on the utility/satisfaction gained from performing each activity while being constrained by time and physical resources. In fact, such parameters as `type' `time of day' `duration' `location' `companionship' and etc. are defining factors in quantifying the utility of activities - a challenging problem which has been the focus of research for many years. This paper proposes a methodology to estimate the parameters of utility distributions for joint and solo activities, along with the penalty values associated with the deviation of activity start time and duration from their modal values. The study utilizes travel survey data collected in Frauenfeld, Switzerland, over the period of six weeks in 2003. The proposed model is a bi-level optimization model, where the upper level maximizes the accuracy of the activity scheduling on the aggregate level and is measured using the outputs of lower level optimization models. Each lower level model is a variation of pickup and delivery problem and schedules activities for each individual in the population using the parameters of utility distribution and penalty values generated by the Genetic Algorithm. The results indicate that travelers are trying to be more consistent with their arrival time to work, school and pickup/drop off activities: the associated penalty values for deviation from the modal value for arrival time to work and school activities are high. Additionally, significant differences in the parameters of the estimated utility distribution for joint and solo activities are observed, reflecting the fact that utility gained from joint and solo activities are different and needs more in-depth investigation. The proposed methodology has the potential to be applied to any multiday travel survey data, which due to advances made in handheld smart devices and mobile applications are becoming more convenient to collect.},

The model is based on the theoretical framework we proposed in earlier work which assumes that utilities of activities are a dynamic function of needs of individuals at person and household levels. In the model, individuals use a utility-of-time threshold parameter to decide when to include an activity in their agenda. The threshold represents a personal perception of time pressure and is continuously adapted based on learning. In an exchange phase, the individuals (re-)allocate household tasks based on a negotiation protocol with the aim of improving the group result. The model takes into account day-varying time-budgets of individuals, influences of perception, selfishness-altruism, joint activity participation and competences of individuals to satisfy particular needs. We illustrate the model by means of simulations and suggest ways for future research. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Bernardo2015a,
	abstract = {This paper examines the time-use patterns of adults in dual-earner households with and without children as a function of several individual and household socio-demographics and employment characteristics. A disaggregate activity purpose classification including both in-home and out-of-home activity pursuits is used because of the travel demand relevance of out-of-home pursuits, as well as to examine both mobility-related and general time-use related social exclusion and time poverty issues. The study uses the Nested Multiple Discrete Continuous Extreme Value (MDCNEV) model, which recognizes that time-decisions entail the choice of participating in one or more activity purposes along with the amount of time to invest in each chosen activity purpose, and allows generic correlation structures to account for common unobserved factors that might impact the choice of multiple alternatives. The 2010 American Time Use Survey (ATUS) data is used for the empirical analysis. A major finding of the study is that the presence of a child in dual-earner households not only leads to a reduction in in-home non-work activity participation (excluding child care activities) but also a substantially larger decrease in out-of-home non-work activity participation (excluding child care and shopping activities), suggesting a higher level of mobility-related social exclusion relative to overall time-use social exclusion. To summarize, the results in the paper underscore the importance of considering household structure in activity-based travel demand models, as well as re-designing work policies in the United States to facilitate a reduction in work-family conflict in dual-earner families.},

	abstract = {This paper develops and estimates a multiple discrete continuous extreme value model of household activity generation that jointly predicts the activity participation decisions of all individuals in a household by activity purpose and the precise combination of individuals participating. The model is estimated on a sample obtained from the post census regional household travel survey conducted by the South California Association of Governments in the year 2000. A host of household, individual, and residential neighborhood accessibility measures are used as explanatory variables. The results reveal that, in addition to household and individual demographics, the built environment of the home zone also impacts the activity participation levels and durations of households. A validation exercise is undertaken to evaluate the ability of the proposed model to predict participation levels and durations. In addition to providing richness in behavioral detail, the model can be easily embedded in an activity-based microsimulation framework and is computationally efficient as it obviates the need for several hierarchical sub-models typically used in extant activity-based systems to generate activity patterns. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

@article{Bhat2018,
	abstract = {Traditional multiple discrete--continuous (MDC) models generally predict the continuous consumption quantity component reasonably component well, but not necessarily the discrete choice component. In this paper, we propose, for the first time, a new flexible closed-form MDCEV model that breaks the tight linkage between the discrete and continuous choice dimensions of the traditional MDC models. We do so by (1) employing a linear utility function of consumption for the first outside good (which removes the continuous consumption quantity of the outside good from the discrete consumption decision, and also helps in forecasting), and (2) using separate baseline utilities for the discrete and continuous consumption decisions. In the process of proposing our new formulation, we also revisit two issues related to the traditional MDC model. The first relates to clarification regarding the identification of the scale parameter of the error terms, and the second relates to the probability of the discrete choice component of the traditional MDC model (that is, the multivariate probability of consumption or not of the alternatives). We show why the scale parameter of the error terms is indeed estimable when a $\gamma$-profile is used, as well as show how one may develop a closed-form expression for the discrete choice consumption probability. The latter contribution also presents a methodology to estimate pure multiple discrete choice models without the need for information on the continuous consumptions. Finally, we also develop forecasting procedures for our new MDC model structure. We demonstrate an application of the proposed model to the case of time-use of individuals. In a comparative empirical assessment of the fit from the proposed model and from the traditional MDCEV models, our proposed model performs better in terms of better predicting both the discrete outcome data as well as the continuous consumptions.},

@article{Bradley2005,
	abstract = {Intra-household interactions constitute an important aspect in modeling activity and travel-related decisions. Recognition of this importance has recently produced a growing body of research on various aspects of modeling intra-household interactions and group decision-making mechanisms as well as first attempts to incorporate intra-household interactions in regional travel demand models. The previously published research works were mostly focused on time allocation aspect and less on generation of activity episodes, trips, and travel tours that are necessary units for compatibility with regional travel demand models. Also, most of the approaches were limited to household heads only and did not consider explicitly the other household members as acting agents in the intra-household decision making. A model is proposed for joint choice of daily activity pattern (DAP) types for all household members that explicitly takes into account added group-wise utilities of joint participation in the same activity. The model is based on the aggregate description of individual DAP types by three main categories - mandatory travel pattern, non-mandatory travel pattern, and at-home pattern. Important intra-household interactions can be captured already at this aggregate level. A choice structure considers all possible combinations of DAPs of all household members as alternatives. Utility function of each alternative includes components corresponding to each individual DAP type as well as group-wise interaction terms that correspond to joint choice of the same pattern by several household members. Statistical analysis of intra-household interactions and estimation results of the choice model are presented. The model estimation has confirmed a strong added utility of joint choice of the same pattern for such person types as non-worker or part time worker in combination with child, two retired persons, two children, and others. The proposed model represents a part of the advanced regional model system being developed for the Atlanta Regional Commission. {\textcopyright} Springer 2005.},

	abstract = {The MDCEV modelling framework has established itself as the preferred method for modelling time allocation, with data very often collected through travel or activity diaries. However, standard implementations fail to recognise the fact that many of these datasets contain information on multiple days for the same individual, with possible correlations and substitution between days. This paper discusses how the theoretical accommodation of these effects is not straightforward, especially with budget constraints at the day and multi-day level. We rely on additive utility functions where we accommodate correlation between activities at the within-day and between-day level using a mixed MDCEV model, with multivariate random distributions. We illustrate our approach using a well-known time use datasets, confirming our theoretical points and highlighting the benefits of allowing for correlation across days in terms of model fit and behavioural insights.},

	abstract = {Conceptual and empirical models of the propensity to perform social activity-travel behavior are described, which incorporate the influence of individual's social context, namely their social networks. More explicitly, the conceptual model develops the concepts of egocentric social networks, social activities, and social episodes, and defines the three sets of aspects that influence the propensity to perform social activities: individual's personal attributes, social network composition, and information and communication technology interaction with social network members. Using the structural equation modeling (SEM) technique and data recently collected in Toronto, the empirical model tests the effect of these three aspects on the propensity to perform social activities. Results suggest that the social networks framework provides useful insights into the role of physical space, social activity types, communication and information technology use, and the importance of 'with whom' the activity was performed with. Overall, explicitly incorporating social networks into the activity-travel behavior modeling framework provides a promising framework to understand social activities and key aspects of the underlying behavioral process. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2006.},

The resulting inventory-based selective household activity routing problem allows activity type choice, duration choice, activity destination choice, departure time, and scheduling of activities, all within space--time--needs constraints. A Lagrangian relaxation-based algorithm is proposed to solve the model for multiple days. A computational study is conducted. The model can measure several effects: heterogeneity in impacts of travel time changes on different days; the use of dual price as a threshold when needs play a role in the utility maximisation objectives; the possibility for activity participation consolidation due to increased travel time; and non-uniform impacts of travel time increase on utilities across a heterogeneous population. Comparison of the algorithm's performance against a commercial package showed average objective values that differed by only 1.8{\%} or less.},

The main focus of the study is the inclusion of past history of activity involvement and its influence on current activity choice. The econometric formulation adopted, explicitly accounts both for correlation across alternatives and for state dependency. The results indicate that behavioral variables are superior to socio-economic variables and that consideration of the correlation pattern over alternatives clearly improves the fit of the model. This is a first but significant contribution to changing the current static demand models into dynamic activity based ones. The availability of other multi-week travel surveys and the progress made recently on advanced econometric techniques should encourage the transferability of this study to different regions or model scale. {\textcopyright} 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

	abstract = {The estimation results are reported of a model of activity scheduling behavior, based on an interactive computer experiment. The model combines the positive features of discrete choice modeling and computational process modeling of activity scheduling decisions. In particular, it describes the pre-trip planning phase, in which individuals decide which activities to perform, where, when, in which sequence and how to travel to the various activity sites. The results indicate that when scheduling their activities, subjects seem to trade-off attributes of activities (time constraints, duration) against attributes of the schedule (time spent on activities, overall travel time).},

	abstract = {This paper develops a model of activity and trip scheduling that combines three elements that have to date mostly been investigated in isolation: the duration of activities, the time-of-day preference for activity participation and the effect of schedule delays on the valuation of activities. The model is an error component discrete choice model, describing individuals' choice between alternative workday activity patterns. The utility function is formulated in a flexible way, applying a bell-shaped component to represent time-of-day preferences for activities. The model was tested using a 2001 data set from the Netherlands. The estimation results suggest that time-of-day preferences and schedule delays associated with the work activity are the most important factors influencing the scheduling of the work tour. Error components included in the model suggest that there is considerable unobserved heterogeneity with respect to mode preferences and schedule delay. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Escorting children to school is a common travel arrangement in a household with schoolchildren. This escorting task affects travel patterns of the adult household members as accommodations are made for dropping children off at school or picking them up or doing both. Approaches to modeling joint travel arrangements between adults and children with respect to escorting have been previously suggested. However, examples of implementing such models in the framework of an operational activity-based model (ABM) are limited. This paper focuses on the explicit modeling of the escorting of children to school by adults and takes into account the possible bundling of escorting tasks in households with multiple children. The developed model is part of the regional ARM system currently being developed for the Maricopa Association of Governments in Arizona. Such a model allows for constraining the travel schedules of workers who tend to escort children on their way to and from work. Escorting has important policy implications because workers who escort children to and from school are very restricted in changing their departure times to and from work and in switching to transit; these restrictions are not evident otherwise. A choice model was formulated and estimated for each household by outbound (to school) and inbound (from school) escorting needs that were dependent on the number of schoolchildren, options of bundling children for escorting on one tour, and number of available chauffeurs in the household.},

	abstract = {The paper presents the results of an investigation on daily activity-travel scheduling behaviour of older people by using an advanced econometric model and a household travel survey, collected in the National Capital Region (NCR) of Canada in 2011. The activity-travel scheduling model considers a dynamic time--space constrained scheduling process. The key contribution of the paper is to reveal daily activity-travel scheduling behaviour through a comprehensive econometric framework. The resulting empirical model reveals many behavioural details. These include the role that income plays in moderating out-of-home time expenditure choices of older people. Older people in the highest and lowest income categories tend to have lower variations in time expenditure choices than those in middle-income categories. Overall, the time expenditure choices become more stable with increasing age, indicating that longer activity durations and lower activity frequency become more prevalent with increasing age. Daily activity type and location choices reveal a clear random utility-maximizing rational behaviour of older people. It is clear that increasing spatial accessibility to various activity locations is a crucial factor in defining daily out-of-home activity participation of older people. It is also clear that the diversity of out-of-home activity type choices reduces with increasing age and older people are more sensitive to auto travel time than to transit or non-motorized travel time.},

	abstract = {Activity schedules are an important input for travel demand models. This paper presents a model to generate activity schedules for one week. The approach, called actiTopp, is based on the concept of utility-based regression models and stepwise modeling. In contrast to most of the existing models, actiTopp covers the time period of one week. Few models have covered one week; thus, the activity generation approach of this simulation period is rare. Analysis of weekly activity behavior shows stability between different days (e.g., working durations). Hence, the model explicitly takes these aspects into account, for example, by defining time budgets to spread durations within the week. For model estimation, the study used data from the German Mobility Panel (MOP). This annual survey collects representative data on the travel behavior of the German population. The data from 2004-2013 provide more than 17,500 activity schedules for one week, with more than 450,000 activities. Selected results are shown for the model application to 2014 MOP data, which the study used for validation purposes. The mean value of activities per person and week show a difference of 0.3 activity. To evaluate the model, the study used Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests with a significance level of = 0.001. For the activity type distribution of the 2014 sample, the analysis could not reject the null hypothesis of equality of the distribution of the model and the survey data at this significance level.},

	abstract = {Activity conflict resolution as the core of scheduling process in activity-based modeling is a challenging step because the activity diary databases mostly report the outcome of the scheduling decisions and often fail to capture key factors influencing the resolution process itself. Consequently, most activity-based frameworks ignore modeling this process by using either predefined set of activity patterns or priority-based assumptions to schedule daily activities and prevent conflict occasions. ADAPTS is one of the few activity-based models that attempts to simulate the process of activity scheduling and resolve the conflicts as they occur. This paper advances the current rule-based conflict resolution model of ADAPTS by implementing an advanced and flexible non-linear optimization model. A set of linear optimization sub-models is then proposed that together perform the same task as the non-linear model, however they are much easier to implement and maintain, while fast to run and flexible to extend. The proposed approach defines an objective function, which aims to minimize the extent of changes in timing and duration of conflicting activities, while fitting them in the schedule. Comparing performance of the proposed model with TASHA scheduler and former resolution module of ADAPTS using CHASE scheduling process data reveals significant improvement in fitting the newly planned activities in the schedules with the minimal modifications in the timing and duration of activities.},

	abstract = {In this paper, an integrated destination choice model based on routing and scheduling considerations of daily activities is proposed. Extending the Household Activity Pattern Problem (HAPP), the Location Selection Problem (LSP-HAPP) demonstrates how location choice is made as a simultaneous decision from interactions both with activities having predetermined locations and those with many candidate locations. A dynamic programming algorithm, developed for PDPTW, is adapted to handle a potentially sizable number of candidate locations. It is shown to be efficient for HAPP and LSP-HAPP applications. The algorithm is extended to keep arrival times as functions for mathematical programming formulations of activity-based travel models that often have time variables in the objective. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

While most past projects have focused on isolated network components, this paper presents a study collecting data on connected personal networks by taking a snowball sample. The paper explains difficulties for transport planning in approaching and explaining leisure travel and then introduces both the survey methodology and the instrument in detail. Advantages and disadvantages of snowball sampling are addressed, and the question why this strategy is important for approaching leisure travel, followed by experiences from the field about response rate, the ft between survey and target population, and sources of bias are given.

	abstract = {The ageing population has become a global problem in which enhanced understanding on their activity-travel patterns is needed. In this paper, an analysis of retired and dual-earner couples is conducted to investigate how retirement would change their activity time use and patterns. In particular, intra-household interactions are considered, to explore the interdependencies among household members' choices, social-demographics and travel behaviours. Household survey data from Hong Kong are employed. Results show that retirement would substantially increase joint participations and durations in various out-of-home activities. In addition, the importance of walkability is emphasised for retired couples in a mixed-land-use and transit-dependent city, and a potential social exclusion issue is identified for the low-income retired population. Scenarios analyses including changes of built environment and lifestyles (e.g., telecommuting, online shopping and food delivery) are conducted, to investigate how couples would reallocate the saved travel time. In summary, this paper highlights the importance of considering the group decision mechanism in a household for activity generation and travel demand forecasting. It sheds light on policies to improve quality-of-life for couples before and after the retirement.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a comprehensive econometric modelling framework for daily activity program generation. It is for day-specific activity program generations of a week-long time span. Activity types considered are 15 generic categories of non-skeletal and flexible activities. Under the daily time budget and non-negativity of participation rate constraints, the models predict optimal sets of frequencies of the activities under consideration (given the average duration of each activity type). The daily time budget considers at-home basic needs and night sleep activities together as a composite activity. The concept of composite activity ensures the dynamics and continuity of time allocation and activity/travel behaviour by encapsulating altogether the activity types that are not of our direct interest in travel demand modelling. Workers' total working hours (skeletal activity and not a part of the non-skeletal activity time budget) are considered as a variable in the models to accommodate the scheduling effects inside the generation model of non-skeletal activities. Incorporation of previous day's total executed activities as variables introduces day-to-day dynamics into the activity program generation models. The possibility of zero frequency of any specific activity under consideration is ensured by the Kuhn-Tucker optimality conditions used for formulating the model structure. Models use the concept of random utility maximization approach to derive activity program set. Estimations of the empirical models are done using the 2002-2003 CHASE survey data set collected in Toronto. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media, LLC. 2008.},

	abstract = {This article presents an econometric modelling framework for activity-agenda formation. The activity-agenda is referred to the collection of different types of activities that are to be scheduled within a specific time period (time budget). The concept of activity utility is used to model frequencies of all individual activity types under consideration within a specific time budget constraint. Contrary to univariate modelling approach for individual activity types separately, this approach deals with all activity types together in a unified econometric modelling framework. The specification of the model also ensures the scope for unplanned (or not defined a priori) activities within the time budget. Kuhn-Tucker optimality condition is used to ensure the probability of having zero frequency of any specific activity type. Each individual activity-specific utility has two components: baseline utility and additional utility. The logarithmic function of additional utility ensures the satiation effect with increasing frequency. The heterogeneity in activity behaviour is also considered by incorporating error correlation in baseline utility. Data from the 2002-2003 CHASE survey, collected in Toronto are used to test the model specifications. Application of this modelling framework in an activity-based travel demand model will greatly enhance behavioural validity as well as sensitivity to subtle transportation policies of travel demand models. {\textcopyright} 2009 Hong Kong Society for Transportation Studies Limited.},

	abstract = {The paper presents a modeling framework for dynamic activity scheduling. The modeling framework considers random utility maximization (RUM) assumption for its components in order to capture the joint activity type, location and continuous time expenditure choice tradeoffs over the course of the day. The dynamics of activity scheduling process are modeled by considering the history of activity participation as well as changes in time budget availability over the day. For empirical application, the model is estimated for weekend activity scheduling using a dataset (CHASE) collected in Toronto in 2002-2003. The data set classifies activities into nine general categories. For the empirical model of a 24-h weekend activity scheduling, only activity type and time expenditure choices are considered. The estimated empirical model captures many behavioral details and gives a high degree of fit to the observed weekend scheduling patterns. Some examples of such behavioral details are the effects of time of the day on activity type choice for scheduling and on the corresponding time expenditure; the effects of travel time requirements on activity type choice for scheduling and on the corresponding time expenditure, etc. Among many other findings, the empirical model reveals that on the weekend the utility of scheduling Recreational activities for later in the day and over a longer duration of time is high. It also reveals that on the weekend, Social activity scheduling is not affected by travel time requirements, but longer travel time requirements typically lead to longer-duration social activities. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

Drawing upon the theory of externalities and the sociological notion of social networks, we develop a discrete choice model that incorporates elements of social influence in addition to more conventional factors such as the attributes of alternatives and the characteristics of decisionmakers. Using simulation, we apply the model to the case of telecommuting - that is, the decision to telecommute or not - over two waves. The experiment suggests that some marginal adopters of telecommuting are influenced heavily in the second wave by the decisions of others in the first wave. Furthermore, the example illustrates the importance of social influence on new adopters of telecommuting in the second wave. {\textcopyright} 2007 a Pion publication printed in Great Britain.},

The method uses a genetic algorithm to estimate coefficient values of the utility function, based on a particular multidimensional sequence alignment method to deal with the nominal, discrete attributes of the activity/travel pattern (e.g., which household member performs which activity, which vehicle is used, sequencing of activities), and a time sequence alignment method to handle temporal attributes of the activity pattern (e.g., starting and ending time of each activity and/or travel). The estimation procedure is tested on data drawn from a well-known activity/travel survey. {\textcopyright} 2008 Computer-Aided Civil and Infrastructure Engineering.},

	abstract = {Although stated preference or conjoint-based models have recently found ample application in the transportation literature, there have been no attempts to use this modeling approach to develop an activity-based model of transport demand. The development of such a model, called COBRA, is discussed. The model examines individuals' choices on activity engagement, scheduling, and stop pattern formation. The model is calibrated using experimental design data collected to examine the potential effects of several policies recently proposed in the Netherlands. The modeling results indicate that although people prefer activity schedules involving fewer home-based tours, they do not prefer the combination of all individual trips into a single home-based tour. Furthermore, it is found that individuals will change their activity engagement patterns only if government policies induce substantial changes in individuals' time availability.},

Based on the realization that outputs of complex activity-travel decisions form a continuous pattern in space-time dimension, the estimation framework is treated as a pattern selection problem. In particular, we define a variant of HAPP that has capabilities of forecasting activity selection and durations in addition to activity sequencing. The framework is comprised of three steps, (i) choice set generation, (ii) choice set individualization and (iii) model estimation. The estimation results show that utilities for work, shopping and disutilities for travel time, time outside home, and average tour delay are found to be significant in activity-travel decision making.},

	abstract = {Travel behavior models assuming individual decision-making processes have been a dominant theme in transportation studies. While the assumption that an individual can decide on all relevant aspects of some types of travel behavior may be reasonable, in many other aspects household members interact before making decisions about different activities that they perform and the time that is involved. On the other hand, different types of households may show different group decision-making mechanisms. In other words, there might exist diverse intra-household interactions during joint decision-making processes. To reflect this point, this paper aims to develop a new household time allocation model based on the iso-elastic class of social welfare function, which can include different types of household utility functions as special cases (e.g., Nash, utilitarianism, autocratic and max-min types). Throughout this empirical analysis, which uses an activity diary data collected in a depopulated region of Japan, the effectiveness of the proposed model is confirmed. Furthermore, the model's applicability in evaluating transportation policies for elderly people is examined based on a simulation analysis. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This paper employed a network analysis approach to detecting daily activity-travel patterns of 680 Beijing's residents within a week and then used a multilevel multinomial logit model to analyze the intrapersonal variability in patterns and the socioeconomic linkages behind them. Results suggest that most activity-travel patterns have significant day-to-day intrapersonal and interpersonal variabilities. This suggests that the application of a typical day of activity-travel behaviors to measure and represent a week's or even longer-term behaviors may be biased, due to the existence of day-to-day intrapersonal variability. This study also provides a hint for the selection of days of a week to conduct a diary survey for activity pattern mining or travel demand modeling.},

	abstract = {This article presents the MOBIS dataset and underlying survey methods used in its collection. The MOBIS study was a nation-wide randomised controlled trial (RCT) of transport pricing in Switzerland, utilising a combination of postal recruitment, online surveys, and GPS tracking. 21,571 persons completed the first online survey, and 3680 persons completed 8 weeks of GPS tracking. Many continued tracking for over a year after the study was completed. In the field experiment, participants participated through the use of a GPS tracking app, Catch-my-Day, which logged their daily travel on different transport modes and imputed the trip segments and modes. The experiment lasted 8 weeks, bookended by two online surveys. After the first 4-week control phase, participants were split into two different treatment groups and a continued control group. An analysis of the survey participation shows that the technology is capable of supporting such an experiment on both Android and iOS, the two main mobile platforms. Significant differences in the engagement and attrition were observed between iOS and Android participants over the 8-week period. Finally, the attrition rate did not vary between treatment groups. This paper also reports on the wealth of data that are being made available for further research, which includes over 3 million trip stages and activities, labelled with transport mode and purpose respectively.},

	abstract = {Computer-simulated synthetic populations are used by researchers and policy makers to help understand and predict the aggregate behaviour of large numbers of individuals.  Research aims include explaining the structural and dynamic characteristics of populations, and the implications of these characteristics for dynamic processes such as the spread of disease, opinions and social norms.  Policy makers planning for the future economic, healthcare or infrastructure needs of a population want to be able to evaluate the possible effects of their policies.  In both cases, it is desirable that the structure and dynamic behaviour of synthetic populations be statistically congruent to that of real populations.  Here, we present a parsimonious individual-based model for generating synthetic population dynamics that focuses on the effects that demographic change have on the structure and composition of households.},

Data concerning the attributes of social agents, which compose synthetic populations, are particularly important but usually difficult to collect and therefore use in simulations. In this paper, we have reviewed state of the art methodologies and theories for building realistic synthetic populations for agent-based simulation models and practices in social simulations. We also highlight the discrepancies between theory and practice and outline the challenges in bridging this gap through a quantitative and narrative review of work published in JASSS between 2011 and 2021. Finally, we present several recommendations that could help modellers adopt best practices for

	abstract = {The Gibbs sampler is an iterative algorithm used to simulate Gaussian random vectors subject to inequality constraints. This algorithm relies on the fact that the distribution of a vector component conditioned by the other components is Gaussian, the mean and variance of which are obtained by solving a kriging system. If the number of components is large, kriging is usually applied with a moving search neighborhood, but this practice can make the simulated vector not reproduce the target correlation matrix. To avoid these problems, variations of the Gibbs sampler are presented. The conditioning to inequality constraints on the vector components can be achieved by simulated annealing or by restricting the transition matrix of the iterative algorithm. Numerical experiments indicate that both approaches provide realizations that reproduce the correlation matrix of the Gaussian random vector, but some conditioning constraints may not be satisfied when using simulated annealing. On the contrary, the restriction of the transition matrix manages to satisfy all the constraints, although at the cost of a large number of iterations.},

	abstract = {Activity conflict resolution as the core of scheduling process in activity-based modeling is a challenging step because the activity diary databases mostly report the outcome of the scheduling decisions and often fail to capture key factors influencing the resolution process itself. Consequently, most activity-based frameworks ignore modeling this process by using either predefined set of activity patterns or priority-based assumptions to schedule daily activities and prevent conflict occasions. ADAPTS is one of the few activity-based models that attempts to simulate the process of activity scheduling and resolve the conflicts as they occur. This paper advances the current rule-based conflict resolution model of ADAPTS by implementing an advanced and flexible non-linear optimization model. A set of linear optimization sub-models is then proposed that together perform the same task as the non-linear model, however they are much easier to implement and maintain, while fast to run and flexible to extend. The proposed approach defines an objective function, which aims to minimize the extent of changes in timing and duration of conflicting activities, while fitting them in the schedule. Comparing performance of the proposed model with TASHA scheduler and former resolution module of ADAPTS using CHASE scheduling process data reveals significant improvement in fitting the newly planned activities in the schedules with the minimal modifications in the timing and duration of activities.},

We first characterize the sharp identification region of the model's parameters by a finite set of conditional moment inequalities. We then apply our theoretical findings to learn about households' risk preferences and choice sets from data on their deductible choices in auto collision insurance. We find that the data can be explained by expected utility theory with low levels of risk aversion and heterogeneous non-singleton choice sets, and that more than three in four households require limited choice sets to explain their deductible choices. We also provide simulation evidence on the computational tractability of our method in applications with larger feasible sets or higher-dimensional unobserved heterogeneity.},

	abstract = {The paper proposes the microscopic travel demand model continuous target-based activity planning (C-TAP) that generates multi-week schedules by means of a continuous planning approach with an open planning horizon. C-TAP introduces behavioral targets to describe people's motivation to perform activities, and it uses a planning heuristic to make on-the-fly decisions about upcoming activities. The planning heuristic bases its decisions on three aspects: a discomfort index derived from deviations from agents' past performance with regard to their behavioral targets; the effectiveness of the immediate execution; and activity execution options available in the near future. The paper reports the results of a test scenario based on an existing 6-week continuous travel diary and validates C-TAP by comparing simulation results with observed behavioral patterns along several dimensions (weekday similarities, weekday execution probabilities of activities, transition probabilities between activities, duration distributions of activities, frequency distributions of activities, execution interval distributions of activities and weekly travel probability distributions). The results show that C-TAP has the capability to reproduce observed behavior and the flexibility to introduces new behavioral patterns. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

A theoretical model of complex travel behavior is formulated on a recognition of a wide range of interdependencies associated with an individual's travel decisions in a constrained environment. Travel is viewed as input to a more basic process involving activity decisions. A fundamental tenet of this approach is that travel decisions are driven by the collection of activities that form an agenda for participation; the utility of any specific travel decision can be determined only within the context of the entire agenda. Based on the theoretical model of complex travel behavior, an operational system of models, STARCHILD (Simulation of Travel/Activity Responses to Complex Household Interactive Logistic Decisions), has been developed to examine the formation of household travel/activity patterns, and is presented in a companion paper (Recker et al., 1986).},

The method uses a genetic algorithm to estimate coefficient values of the utility function, based on a particular multidimensional sequence alignment method to deal with the nominal, discrete attributes of the activity/travel pattern (e.g., which household member performs which activity, which vehicle is used, sequencing of activities), and a time sequence alignment method to handle temporal attributes of the activity pattern (e.g., starting and ending time of each activity and/or travel).

This paper uses a structural equations modelling (SEM) technique with latent variables to explore these short- and long-term dynamics. Four models are tested, that distinguish between the underlying propensity to perform activities/travel, ``next-day effects'' that relate behaviour in one day to behaviour in the next day, ``same-day effects'' which indicate substitution of out-of-home activities by type and trips by mode within a particular day. Weekday activity/travel patterns are found to be different from weekend patterns. An underlying similarity is found between a person's weekday activity/travel schedules from one year to the next, and latent ``propensity'' variables, which can be represented as a linear function of the socioeconomic characteristics of the person, are found to explain this.},

	abstract = {The focus of this paper is on the demonstration that some rather well-known network-based formulations in operations research, that have heretofore largely gone unnoticed in activity-based travel research, offer a potentially powerful technique for advancing the general development of the activity-based modeling approach. These formulations can provide an analytical framework that unifies the complex interactions among the resource allocation decisions made by households in conducting their daily affairs outside the home, while preserving the utility-maximizing principles presumed to guide such decisions. A mathematical programming formulation is developed and used to identify the similarities and differences between traditional trip-based modeling methodologies and those pertaining to an activity-based approach. It is demonstrated that the two approaches are directly related. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Srinivasan:2002aa,
	abstract = {Previous work with data from the Boston Metropolitan Area has suggested that land use characteristics can have measurable impacts on travel behavior such as trip linking and mode choice at the individual level. However, trip planning, especially in households with children or more than one worker, is quite possibly done at the household level. In this paper, we begin to understand the travel behavior choices of households and understand the relationship of these choices with socio-economic characteristics as well as spatial characteristics of the places where the household resides, works and travels through. The results of preliminary models estimated indicate that the travel behavior of a household is indeed related to the household's residential location. The models estimated are not for the purposes of travel demand forecasting as in the case of the household based Stockholm models. The results do indicate if land use, network and accessibility characteristics also affect household trip linking and mode choice and their relationship to residential choice. Thus, one can begin to determine whether planners can make a difference through the implementation of the ideas of neo-traditional theories in local level planning. These models should provide a starting point for further exploration of the land use and transportation linkages explored from the point of view of the more realistic unit of the household.},

@article{Jiang:2022aa,
	abstract = {Geographically-explicit simulations have become crucial in understanding cities and are playing an important role in Urban Science. One such approach is that of agent-based modeling which allows us to explore how agents interact with the environment and each other (e.g., social networks), and how through such interactions aggregate patterns emerge (e.g., disease outbreaks, traffic jams). While the use of agent-based modeling has grown, one challenge remains, that of creating realistic, geographically-explicit, synthetic populations which incorporate social networks. To address this challenge, this paper presents a novel method to create a synthetic population which incorporates social networks using the New York Metro Area as a test area. To demonstrate the generalizability of our synthetic population method and data to initialize models, three different types of agent-based models are introduced to explore a variety of urban problems: traffic, disaster response, and the spread of disease. These use cases not only demonstrate how our geographically-explicit synthetic population can be easily utilized for initializing agent populations which can explore a variety of urban problems, but also show how social networks can be integrated into such populations and large-scale simulations.},

	abstract = {Many discrete choice contexts in transportation deal with large choice sets, including destination, route, and vehicle choices. Model estimation with large numbers of alternatives remains computationally expensive. In the context of the multinomial logit (MNL) model, limiting the number of alternatives in estimation by simple random sampling (SRS) yields consistent parameter estimates, but estimator efficiency suffers. In the context of more general models, such as the mixed MNL, limiting the number of alternatives via SRS yields biased parameter estimates. In this paper, a new, strategic sampling scheme is introduced, which draws alternatives in proportion to updated choice-probability estimates. Since such probabilities are not known a priori, the first iteration uses SRS among all available alternatives. The sampling scheme is implemented here for a variety of simulated MNL and mixed-MNL data sets, with results suggesting that the new sampling scheme provides substantial efficiency benefits. Thanks to reductions in estimation error, parameter estimates are more accurate, on average. Moreover, in the mixed MNL case, where SRS produces biased estimates (due to violation of the independence of irrelevant alternatives property), the new sampling scheme appears to effectively eliminate such biases. Finally, it appears that only a single iteration of the new strategy (following the initialization step using SRS) is needed to deliver the strategy's maximum efficiency gains.},

	n2 = {Activity schedules are an important input for travel demand models. This paper presents a model to generate activity schedules for one week. The approach, called actiTopp, is based on the concept of utility-based regression models and stepwise modeling. In contrast to most of the existing models, actiTopp covers the time period of one week. Few models have covered one week; thus, the activity generation approach of this simulation period is rare. Analysis of weekly activity behavior shows stability between different days (e.g., working durations). Hence, the model explicitly takes these aspects into account, for example, by defining time budgets to spread durations within the week. For model estimation, the study used data from the German Mobility Panel (MOP). This annual survey collects representative data on the travel behavior of the German population. The data from 2004?2013 provide more than 17,500 activity schedules for one week, with more than 450,000 activities. Selected results are shown for the model application to 2014 MOP data, which the study used for validation purposes. The mean value of activities per person and week show a difference of 0.3 activity. To evaluate the model, the study used Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests with a significance level of α= 0.001. For the activity type distribution of the 2014 sample, the analysis could not reject the null hypothesis of equality of the distribution of the model and the survey data at this significance level.},

The model is an error component discrete choice model, describing individuals'choice between alternative workday activity patterns. The utility function is formulated in a flexible way, applying a bell-shaped component to represent time-of-day preferences for activities. The model was tested using a 2001 data set from the Netherlands. The estimation results suggest that time-of-day preferences and schedule delays associated with the work activity are the most important factors influencing the scheduling of the work tour. Error components included in the model suggest that there is considerable unobserved heterogeneity with respect to mode preferences and schedule delay.},

To date, the conventional approach to synthesizing the base-year population has been based on the iterative proportional fitting procedure. Two issues associated with this conventional approach are discussed: the first is often termed as the zero-cell-value problem, and the second is related to the inability to control for statistical distributions of both household- and individual-level attributes. Then, a new population synthesis procedure is presented that addresses the limitations of the conventional approach. The new procedure is implemented into an operational software system and used to generate synthetic populations for the Dallas?Fort Worth area in Texas. Validation results indicate that the new procedure can produce a synthetic population that more closely represents the true population than the conventional approach can.},

A multiple discrete-continuous extreme value model: formulation and application to discretionary time-use decisions.

This paper examines several issues associated with the MDCEV model and other extant KT multiple discrete-continuous models. Specifically, the paper proposes a new utility function form that enables clarity in the role of each parameter in the utility specification, presents identification considerations associated with both the utility functional form as well as the stochastic nature of the utility specification, extends the MDCEV model to the case of price variation across goods and to general error covariance structures, discusses the relationship between earlier KT-based multiple discrete-continuous models, and illustrates the many technical nuances and identification considerations of the multiple discrete-continuous model structure through empirical examples. The paper also highlights the technical problems associated with the stochastic specification used in the KT-based multiple discrete-continuous models formulated in recent Environmental Economics papers.},

@article{PopuBenAProu08,
	abstract = { Insights into the time-of-day preferences of individuals are crucial for accurately quantifying vehicle emissions and for understanding time-shifting behavior in response to traffic congestion and road pricing. Most urban models account for travel demand by time of day by using fixed factors or by incorporating the choice among aggregate time periods such as a.m., p.m., and off-peak. These methods are inadequate for examining traveler response to congestion mitigation strategies. To address some of these concerns, FHWA recently conducted a research project to develop innovative methods of modeling travel by time of day. This paper extends the FHWA methodology to the Tel Aviv tour-based model system that Cambridge Systematics is currently developing for Israel's Ministry of Transport. The purpose of this paper is threefold: first, it discusses the modeling framework used in Tel Aviv; second, it describes the data inputs required for modeling time-of-day decisions; and finally, it describes the model estimation procedure and empirical results from Tel Aviv. The main features of the modeling approach include using half-hour time intervals, accounting for schedule delay in the absence of desired arrival and departure time data, and modeling the 24-h cycle. This paper serves as a proof of concept for the FHWA methodology and demonstrates that using the commonly available household survey data and some basic level-of-service data makes it possible to develop time-of-day models that are more detailed and better suited for policy testing. },

	abstract = { Understanding the variations in travel by time of day is essential to predicting transportation system performance and air quality impacts of the transportation sector. As tour- and activity-based modeling procedures become more commonplace, the need for accurate time-of-day modeling procedures that are sensitive to changes in policies or travel conditions, such as congestion, that affect time-of-day choices, is clear. FHWA recently conducted a research project to develop new methods of modeling travel by time of day that are sensitive to these concerns. One of the products of this project is a time-of-day choice modeling procedure designed to be applied within tour- or activity-based travel modeling processes. This procedure was designed to be compatible with most existing tour- and activity-based models in the United States. The time-of-day choice model is estimated by using household activity survey data and transportation level-of-service information from the highway network. This procedure was tested by using the activity-based travel model for San Francisco County, California. The time-of-day modeling procedure is described, including the model estimation process, data requirements for estimation and application, and the results of the San Francisco test application. The test application included alternative scenarios designed to validate the model's sensitivity to land use, transit level of service, traffic congestion, and time-of-day pricing. },

	abstract = {Discrete choice models, like the multinomial logit (MNL), have long been recognized for their ability to capture a wide array of transport-related choice phenomena. However, a number of choices are continuous response variables (e.g., location, departure time, activity duration, and vehicle usage). This paper introduces the continuous cross-nested logit (CCNL) model. The CCNL model results from generalizing the discrete cross-nested logit (CNL) model for a continuous response variable, much like the continuous logit model emerges by generalizing the MNL. The model is formulated and shown to come from the generalized extreme value (GEV) class of models. In addition, the structure of utility correlations is presented. The model's parameters are estimated for a work-tour departure time context using Bayesian estimation techniques and San Francisco Bay Area data. Empirical results suggest model predictions that are very similar to the continuous logit, but it out-performs the continuous logit in terms of out-of-sample prediction with these data. The CCNL also allows a more flexible choice behavior to emerge. Finally, a simple welfare example is illustrated and a number of model extensions are presented.},

	abstract = {The nested logit model has been used extensively to model multi-dimensional choice situations. A drawback of the nested logit model is that it does not allow choice alternatives to share common unobserved attributes along all the dimensions characterizing the multidimensional choice context. This paper formulates a mixed multinomial logit structure that accommodates unobserved correlation across both dimensions in a two-dimensional choice context. The mixed multinomial logit structure is parsimonious in the number of parameters to be estimated and is also relatively easy to estimate using simulation methods. The mixed multinomial logit model is applied to an analysis of travel mode and departure time choice for home-based social--recreational trips using data drawn from the 1990 San Francisco Bay Area household survey. The empirical results underscore the need to capture unobserved attributes along both the mode and departure time dimensions, both for improved data fit as well as for more realistic policy evaluations of transportation control measures.},

	abstract = { Modeling of departure time choice has recently received renewed attention because of the increasing levels of congestion in many cities and the growing popularity of travel demand management strategies such as road pricing. Current practice for evaluation of the effectiveness of travel demand management policies usually involves incorporation of the temporal dimension into transport planning models only through fixed factors derived from origin--destination data, but this practice makes them unsuitable for use in proper prediction of demand at different times of the day. To mitigate these deficiencies, the authors argue in favor of estimation and application of specially formulated time-of-day choice models. Here the concentration is on the process used to generate a survey design that obtains data suitable for estimation of such models that will ensure both realism and simplicity in the presentation; in particular, the stated preference exercise includes dependence between attribute levels.

	abstract = {The reference point hypothesis of prospect theory is applied to commuters' departure time decision-making and to obtain a better understanding of how commuters use arrival time information in daily departure time choice. There are two reference points defined in this study: the earliest acceptable arrival time and the work starting time for a given commuter. An arrival is defined as an early-side arrival if the arrival time is earlier than his/her preferred arrival time, and a late-side arrival otherwise. A gain occurs when a commuter experiences an arrival time that is between his/her earliest acceptable arrival time and work starting time; this is assumed to enhance the likelihood of choosing the same departure time. Similarly, a loss is observed when the commuter experiences an arrival time which is outside that range; this is assumed to reduce the likelihood of choosing that departure time. The empirical results indicate that around 20% of commuters are likely to switch their departure times and routes and most of commuters experience gains, and that preferred arrival times of commuters tend to be near their work starting times. Most importantly, it is shown that, consistent with prospect theory, commuters react asymmetrically to gains and losses.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a continuous-time hazard duration model for urban shopping trip departure time choice. The time frame for the analysis of departure time is the entire day. The continuous-time model uses a non-parametric baseline hazard distribution, employs a non-parametric representation for the time-varying effect of covariates, and accommodates time-varying covariates. These econometric issues are important to recognize and consider in a departure time model spanning the entire day. The model also accommodates unobserved heterogeneity and recognizes the ``rounding'' of reported departure times by individuals in surveys to an integral multiple of 5 min. The continuous-time model is estimated using shopping trip data from the 1996 activity survey collected in the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area. The effects of individual and household socio-demographics, employment attributes, and trip-related characteristics on departure time choice are presented and discussed. Application of the continuous-time model to forecast temporal shifts in shopping trip-making due to changes in socio-demographic characteristics and trip-chaining behavior is demonstrated. The use of the formulation as a powerful evaluation tool to manage and influence traffic patterns through dynamic congestion pricing control schemes is also highlighted.},

@article{CHIN1990321,
	abstract = {This paper provides empirical evidence to support the widely held view that institutional factors such as official work start times and staggered working hours are powerful policy tools in traffic management and in influencing travel behaviour. This approach is to be preferred over continued investment in infrastructure given the scarcity of land in Singapore. A more efficient use of existing infrastructure could be achieved by spreading peak travel. Full utilisation of the Mass Rapid Transit will depend on changing the commuter's perception on multi mode travel in addition to using public transport. While many studies have been carried out on modal choice, research on commuter trip departure decisions have been few and remain largely least understood. This paper employs multinomial logit and simultaneous nested logit analysis to model the choice of departure time (using household data collected in Singapore in 1983). Preliminary findings show that schedule delay, travel cost, and journey time to be important influences on commuter's choice of trip departure time to work. Some difficulties are highlighted and suggestions for further research are made.},

The costs of travel include queuing time and schedule delay (time early or late for work). The frequency distribution of departure times adjusts so that in equilibrium all individuals have the same travel costs. The paper extends the previous literature by examining a coarse toll and solving for optimal capacities. The application of congestion tolls can generate efficiency gains by altering the frequency distribution of departure times. Previous estimates of the efficiency gains from congestion tolling are likely to be substantially downward-biased because they have ignored this effect.},

@article{Bhat98b,
	abstract = {Travel mode and departure time choice of urban trips are important determinants of urban travel demand and the temporal distribution of this demand. While mode choice has received substantial attention in travel demand modeling, relatively little attention has been directed toward departure time choice. Further, the work trip has been the focus of most earlier mode choice research, and almost all earlier departure time choice research. The current paper examines the joint nature of mode and departure time choice for urban shopping trips. The model formulation in the paper adopts a nested structure with mode choice at the higher level of the hierarchy and departure time choice at the lower level. A multinomial logit (MNL) form is used for modeling mode choice and an ordered generalized extreme value (OGEV) form, which recognizes the natural temporal ordering of the departure time alternatives, is adopted for departure time choice. The proposed MNL-OGEV model is applied to data obtained from the 1990 San Francisco Bay area travel survey and is found to perform better than the MNL and nested logit models. In addition, the results indicate that the MNL and nested logit models lead to biased level-of-service estimates and to inappropriate policy evaluations of transportation control measures in the current empirical context.},

@article{BHAT2005679,
	abstract = {Several consumer demand choices are characterized by the choice of multiple alternatives simultaneously. An example of such a choice situation in activity-travel analysis is the type of discretionary (or leisure) activity to participate in and the duration of time investment of the participation. In this context, within a given temporal period (say a day or a week), an individual may decide to participate in multiple types of activities (for example, in-home social activities, out-of-home social activities, in-home recreational activities, out-of-home recreational activities, and out-of-home non-maintenance shopping activities). In this paper, we derive and formulate a utility theory-based model for discrete/continuous choice that assumes diminishing marginal utility as the level of consumption of any particular alternative increases (i.e., satiation). This assumption yields a multiple discreteness model (i.e., choice of multiple alternatives can occur simultaneously). This is in contrast to the standard discrete choice model that is based on assuming the absence of any diminishing marginal utility as the level of consumption of any alternative increases (i.e., no satiation), leading to the case of strictly single discreteness. The econometric model formulated here, which we refer to as the multiple discrete--continuous extreme value (MDCEV) model, has a surprisingly simple and elegant closed form expression for the discrete--continuous probability of not consuming certain alternatives and consuming given levels of the remaining alternatives. To our knowledge, we are the first to develop such a simple and powerful closed-form model for multiple discreteness in the literature. This formulation should constitute an important milestone in the area of multiple discreteness, just as the multinomial logit (MNL) represented an important milestone in the area of single discreteness. Further, the MDCEV model formulated here has the appealing property that it collapses to the familiar multinomial logit (MNL) choice model in the case of single discreteness. Finally, heteroscedasticity and/or correlation in unobserved characteristics affecting the demand of different alternatives can be easily incorporated within the MDCEV model framework using a mixing approach. The MDCEV model and its mixed variant are applied to analyze time-use allocation decisions among a variety of discretionary activities on weekends using data from the 2000 San Francisco Bay Area survey.},

Even in the case of urban work trips, probably one of the most tightly constrained of everyday activities, schedule shifting is found to be of quantitative importance for the understanding of urban transportation systems. It seems likely that this approach can be applied productively to other goods subject to peaked demands, including electricity, telephone service, computer services, and products with seasonal demands. In short, much of economic analysis could be profitably modified to include scheduling behaviour.-from Author},

@article{guevarainitial2018,
	abstract = {Learning-based models that capture travelers' day-to-day learning processes in repeated travel choices could benefit from ubiquitous sensors such as smartphones, which provide individual-level longitudinal data to help validate and improve such models. However, the common problem of missing initial observations in longitudinal data collection can lead to inconsistent estimates of perceived value of attributes in question, and thus inconsistent parameter estimates. In this paper, the stated problem is addressed by treating the missing observations as latent variables in an instance-based learning model that is estimated via maximum simulated likelihood (MSL). The MSL method is implemented in practice using random sampling and importance sampling. Monte Carlo experimentation based on synthetic data shows that both the MSL with random sampling (MSLrs) and MSL with importance sampling (MSLis) are effective in correcting for the endogeneity problem in that the percent error and empirical coverage of the estimators are greatly improved after the correction. Compared to the MSLrs method, the MSLis method is superior in both effectiveness and computational efficiency. Furthermore, MSLis passes a formal statistical test for the recovery of the population values up to a scale with a large number of missing observations, while MSLrs systematically fails due to the curse of dimensionality. The impacts of sampling size in MSLrs and number of high probability choice sequences in MSLis on the methods' performances are investigated the methods are applied to an experimental route-choice dataset to demonstrate their empirical application. Hausman\textendash McFadden tests show that the estimators after correction are statistically equal to the estimators of the full dataset without missing observations, confirming that the proposed methods are practical and effective for addressing the stated problem.},

Rather than attempting to obtain the joint distribution of all outcomes of the endogenous variables, I propose finding the distribution conditional on the initial value (and the observed history of strictly exogenous explanatory variables). The approach is flexible, and results in simple estimation strategies for at least three leading dynamic, nonlinear models: probit, Tobit and Poisson regression. I treat the general problem of estimating average partial effects, and show that simple estimators exist for important special cases. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

@article{Card97,
	abstract = {Two new classes of probability distributions are introduced that radically simplify the process of developing variance components structures for extreme-value and logistic distributions. When one of these new variates is added to an extreme-value (logistic) variate, the resulting distribution is also extreme value (logistic). Thus, quite complicated variance structures can be generated by recursively adding components having this new distribution, and the result will retain a marginal extreme-value (logistic) distribution. It is demonstrated that the computational simplicity of extreme-value error structures extends to the introduction of heterogeneity in duration, selection bias, limited-dependent- and qualitative-variable models. The usefulness of these new classes of distributions is illustrated with the examples of nested logit, multivariate risk, and competing risk models, where important generalizations to conventional stochastic structures are developed. The new models are shown to be computationally simpler and far more tractable than alternatives such as estimation by simulated moments. These results will be of considerable use to applied microeconomic researchers who have been hampered by computational difficulties in constructing more sophisticated estimators.},

@article{SaloBenA83,
	abstract = {The concept of life-style is becoming a major differentiating trait between population groups substituting for economic and social classes.This paper describes the utilization of the concept of life-style in the context of travel demand models. Life-style is defined as a pattern of behavior under constrained resources which conforms to the orientations an individual has toward three major `life decisions' he or she must make: (a) formation of a household (of any type), (b) participation in the labor force, and (c) orientation toward leisure.A population is classified into life-style groups based on similarity in a multivariate space. Socioeconomic and demographic variables define that space, and emphasis is put on variables which are indicative of emerging new life-styles (for example, the relative contribution of the female spouse to the household income). Cluster analysis is employed to identify the life-style groups.Models for the combinations of choice of mode and destination for shopping trips are estimated for the pooled sample and the life-style segments. Comparisons of these models with the performance of other market segmentation schemes and with the pooled model demonstrate that the life-style groups account for taste variations better than the other schemes.},

This method of simulated moments (MSM) does not require precise estimates of these probabilities for consistency and asymptotic normality, relying instead on the law of large numbers operating across observations to control simulation error, and hence can use simulations of practical size. The method is useful for models such as high-dimensional multinomial probit (MNP), where computation has restricted applications.},

@article{BenAGers98,
	abstract = { Many consumer choice situations involve the selection of optional items or features from a menu. Often, in these situations, predesigned bundles or packages of items are also offered. We present an analytical approach to these menu situations which takes into account the large number of alternatives they represent, the interrelated nature of demand for the individual items, and the impact of bundling of items. The emphasis of our data-collection approach is on providing a realistic choice setting which represents all possible alternatives. In our modelling approach, we employ discrete choice modelling techniques which explicitly capture the full range of these alternatives. We present the results of an empirical study of enhanced custom-calling features for residential telephone service. Using this approach, we developed well-behaved choice models that were used to predict demand and revenues for the features under a wide range of marketing scenarios. },

In this paper a maximum-likelihood method based on the conditional distribution given minimal sufficient statistics for the incidental parameters is suggested. It is proved that conditional maximum-likelihood estimates in the regular case are consistent and asymptotically normally distributed with a simple asymptotic variance.

Individual-level choice sets are estimated using a Bayesian updating procedure in conjunction with the multinomial logit model. The authors apply the procedure to scanner panel data for the liquid laundry detergent category. An analysis of estimated choice sets across panelists reveals that market share does not "go hand-in-hand" with choice set share (the percentage of choice sets in which a brand is a member). Examining choice set membership patterns, such as the cooccurrence of brands in the same product line, also provides insight into sister-brand cannibalization. Estimation results also show that promotions can expand choice sets, providing excluded brands a means to gain entry and long-term sales benefits.},

	abstract = {In this paper a new estimator is proposed for discrete choice models with choice-based sampling. The estimator is efficient and can incorporate information on the marginal choice probabilities in a straightforward manner and for that case leads to a procedure that is computationally and intuitively more appealing than the estimators that have been proposed before. The idea is to start with a flexible parameterization of the distribution of the explanatory variables and then rewrite the estimator to remove dependence on these parametric assumptions.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a model with polychotomous choices and
                  selectivity and then applies it to the problem of
                  estimating the returns to technical school
                  training. Using the National Longitudinal Survey
                  data set on young men the paper finds evidence of
                  self-selectivity in the high school wage equation
                  and estimates the wage effect of technical school to
                  be a \$1.27 per hour increase in wages. This amounts
                  to an estimated rate of return of 9\% to 11.2\%,
                  which is slightly higher than estimates obtained by
                  others. Without correcting for selectivity bias the
                  rate of return is underestimated by 6\%.},

Although the conceptual foundations, theory, and methodology have a long tradition, until recently an aggregate trip-based approach dominated transportation science and planning. Changes in the business and policy environment for transportation and the increasingly availability of disaggregate mobility data have led to ABA emerging as the dominant approach. This chapter reviews the ABA conceptual foundations and methodologies. ABA techniques include data-driven methods that analyze mobility data directly as well as develop inputs for ABA modeling. ABA models include econometric models, rule-based models and microsimulation/agent-based models. This chapter concludes by identifying major research frontiers in ABA.},

	abstract = {Fosgerau et al. (2013) recently proposed the recursive logit (RL) model for route choice problems, that can be consistently estimated and easily used for prediction without any sampling of choice sets. Its estimation however requires solving many large-scale systems of linear equations, which can be computationally costly for real data sets. We design a decomposition (DeC) method in order to reduce the number of linear systems to be solved, opening the possibility to estimate more complex RL based models, for instance mixed RL models. We test the performance of the DeC method by estimating the RL model on two networks of more than 7000 and 40,000 links, and we show that the DeC method significantly reduces the estimation time. We also use the DeC method to estimate two mixed RL specifications, one using random coefficients and one incorporating error components associated with subnetworks (Frejinger and Bierlaire 2007). The models are estimated on a real network and a cross-validation study is performed. The results suggest that the mixed RL models can be estimated in a reasonable time with the DeC method. These models yield sensible parameter estimates and the in-sample and out-of sample fits are significantly better than the RL model.},
